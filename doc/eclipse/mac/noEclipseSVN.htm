<h1>Eclipse is unaware of the version control aspects of the Ptolemy II project, use the shell version of Subversion to update the tree.</h1>

Use this method if getting the Eclipse plug-in named "Subversive" is not working for you.
To try to install the Eclipse plug-in named "Subersive", see <a href="eclipseSVN.htm" target="main">Eclipse is aware of the Subversion aspects of the project</a>.</p>

<p>For other ways to set up Eclipse and Ptolemy II, see
the <a href="project.htm" target="main">Setting up Eclipse to manage
your Ptolemy II development Environment</a> page.</p>

<ol>
   <li>Mac OS X already has Subversion installed.
       To test this, start up a Terminal window and run <code>svn help</code>.
	<br/> If <code>svn</code> is not found, then install <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">XCode</a>.
	<br/> Note that XCode is roughly a 1 gigabyte download.  
	<br/> Apple is charging $5 for XCode 4, but XCode 3 will also work.
   </li>
  <li> To check out the ptII svn repository with <b>read-only</b> access:
     <pre>
     svn co https://source.eecs.berkeley.edu/svn/chess/ptII/trunk ptII
     </pre>
     <br><B>Note:</B> Most users will select <CODE>https://</CODE> because
     they will be accessing the tree with <B>read-only</B> Subversion access.
    <br>If you have an 
    <a href="http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/#in_browser" target="_top">ssh account</a>
    on <code>source.eecs.berkeley.edu</code>, then check out ptII with
    read/write access:
    <pre>
    svn co svn+ssh://source.eecs.berkeley.edu/chess/ptII/trunk ptII
    </pre>
    Or, if your user id on source.eecs is different than your current user id
    on your machine:
    <pre>
    svn co svn+ssh://<I>yourID@</I>source.eecs.berkeley.edu/chess/ptII/trunk ptII
    </pre>
    <br/>We provide read/write access via https to our sponors.  Most read/write
    access occurs via svn+ssh://
