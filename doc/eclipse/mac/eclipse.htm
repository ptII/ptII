    <h1>Mac OS X: Installing Eclipse</h1>

    Download the latest version of Eclipse from
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/#in_browser" target="_top">http://www.eclipse.org</a>.
    <br>In August, 2011, we chose
    <B>Eclipse for RCP and RAP Developers</B>, which is 179Mb.
    The <B>Eclipse for RCP and RAP Developers</B> version includes the
    plug-in development environment (PDE), which is needed by the backtrack
    facility, which is an optional part of Ptolemy II that allows models to
    restore their old state.  If the version of Eclipse that you install
    does not have the PDE, then there will be build errors, which can be fixed by
    excluding <CODE>ptolemy/backtrack/</CODE> from the build.

    <p>Eclipse is available as both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.  Deciding
      which one to download can be complex.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion)</dt>
      <dd>Use the 64-bit Eclipse (Lion does not include a 32-bit JVM)</dd>

      <dt>Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard)</dt>
      <dd>Use the 64-bit Eclipse (Snow Leopard <i>might</i> have a 32-bit JVM, see <a href="32bitVs64bit.htm">32-bit or 64-bit</a>)</dd>

      <dt>Mac OS X 10.5 </dt>
      <dd>Use the 32-bit Eclipse, see <a href="32bitVs64bit.htm">32-bit or 64-bit</a></dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Once you have determined whether to use a 32-bit version of
      Eclipse or a 64-bit version, perform these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the Eclipse file, double click on it, which will expand tar file
	and create <code>eclipse/</code>.</li>
      <li>Move <code>eclipse/</code> into <code>/Applications</code>,
      which will
      create <code>/Applications/eclipse/Eclipse.app</code></li>

      <li>Click on the Eclipse icon, which will start up Eclipse.</li>
      <li>Go to <a href="preferences.htm" target="main">Setting the Eclipse Preferences</a>.</li>
    </ol>
</ul>
