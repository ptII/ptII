    <h1>Windows: Installing Java</h1>
    Under Windows, the Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed from Oracle, see
    <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html#in_browser" target="_top"><code>http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</code></a>.
    <p>Java is available as both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries.  Deciding
      which one to download can be complex, see <a href="32bitVs64bit.htm">32-bit or 64-bit</a>.</p>

    <p>Ptolemy II requires Java 1.6 (also known as Java 6) or later because ptdb uses javax.swing.GroupLayout.
      Also, Java 1.5 is past its end of life.  Java 1.7 (also known as Java 7) will work.</p>

    <p>The Oracle (formerly Sun) Java Development Kit (JDK) is preferred.</p>  
    <p>The IBM JDK will work under Linux.</p>
    <p>OpenJDK may work with Ptolemy II, but could have problems with Kepler.</p>

    <p>After installing Java, then the next step is to <a href="eclipse.htm">install Eclipse</a>.
