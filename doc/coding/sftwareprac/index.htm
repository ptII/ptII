<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
In the Ptolemy project at UC Berkeley, we have been exploring ways of improving our software development process. Unlike many other efforts at improving software development, our efforts are focused on the particular needs of leading-edge academic research. High levels of creativity and flexibility are paramount in this environment, and the goals and qualifications of those producing the software are substantially different from those in commercial software production. This report describes our efforts to meet these needs and what we have learned.
