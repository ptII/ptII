<h1>Ptolemy II Type System</h1>
<p>

Ptolemy II has a sophisticated type system that supports extensive
polymorphism. The basis for the type system is a complete partial order
(CPO) representing the relationships between types. The ordering
relationship is one of lossless convertibility. I.e., type <i>a</i> is
less than type <i>b</i> if an instance of type <i>a</i> can be
converted losslessly to an instance of type <i>b</i>. For example, type
<i>IntToken</i> is less than type <i>DoubleToken</i> which is less than
<i>ComplexToken</i>. However, <i>BooleanToken</i> is incomparable to
all of these (it is neither less than nor greater than them). A lesser
type is <i>more specific</i> than a greater type, or a greater type is
<i>more general</i>. Type constraints in an actor are specified as
inequalities with respect to this CPO. Thus, for example, an actor may
declare that its output type is at least the type of one of its
parameters. The type resolution mechanism finds the least types (the
most specific types) in the CPO that satisfy all the constraints.
