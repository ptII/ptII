# This awk script is used to generate vergil compatible html files by
# reading in a html file and printing out the header up to and including
# <body>, and then only printing sections of the input that start
# with <!--vergilDocs--> and end with <!--/vergilDocs-->
# 
# To run this script, do
# awk -f javahtml.awk foo.htm > fooVergil.htm

	print "     where x.x is the release number, then run 'make update'"
        print "     to update the derived files and check them in to cvs. -->"
