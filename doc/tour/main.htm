<a name="domain">Application Domain-Specific Modeling</a>
</h2>
Ptolemy II can be used to build sophisticated application domain-specific modeling capabilities
and frameworks. These frameworks can be packaged as separate executable
applications (e.g. HyVisual or VisualSense)
or accessed from within Ptolemy II. Here, we illustrate some such frameworks.

WirelessSoundDetection</a> (see also the
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/visualsense/" target="_top">VisualSense</a> package).
<br> The wireless domain in Ptolemy II
provides discrete-event modeling of wireless communication systems.
It is useful for modeling and design of communication protocols,
networking strategies, and applications such as sensor networks.
The
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/visualsense/" target="_top">VisualSense</a> package
is a subset of Ptolemy II that includes the wireless domain and channel models
plus domains that support the design of nodes in a wireless network.
The <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/wireless/demo/WirelessSoundDetection/WirelessSoundDetection.htm">
WirelessSoundDetection</a> example models a sound localization problem, where single sound source
moves through a field of sound sensors. In the example, sound sensors detect the sound
and communicate via a radio channel to a sensor fusion component that
localizes the sound by triangulation. Two distinct channel models are used,
one that models sound propagation and one that models radio communication.

<i>Hybrid systems</i> are a special case of modal models
where finite-state machines (FSMs) are combined with the continuous-time (CT) models
to get mixed continuous-time and discrete-event models.
The 
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/hyvisual/" target="_top">HyVisual</a> package
is a subset of Ptolemy II that includes the FSM and CT domains and libraries
that support the design of hybrid systems.

).
<br>
Stochastic hybrid systems add random behavior to continuous-time models mixed
with discrete events. The 
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Spontaneous/IncreasingRatePoisson.htm">IncreasingRatePoisson</a>
models spontaneous mode transitions governed by a Poisson process.
The <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Hysteresis/HysteresisWithRandomDelay.htm">HysteresisWithRandomDelay</a>
example uses similar spontaneous mode transitions to model random delay in mode transitions.
The <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Brownian/Brownian.htm">Brownian</a> example
models a stochastic differential equation describing a random walk process.

<br>
Ptolemy II includes an extensive library and models of computation suitable for
digital signal processing, communication systems design, and image and video processing.
The <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/MaximumEntropySpectrum/MaximumEntropySpectrum.htm">MaximumEntropySpectrum</a>
example shows spectral estimation of sinusoids in noise.
It illustrates models the use of synchronous dataflow (SDF) for signal
processing, and also shows many basic capabilities like
hierarchical models,
the Expression actor, and the signal processing actor library.


</ul>
<h2>
<a name="heterogeneous">Heterogeneous Models</a>
</h2>
A particular capability of Ptolemy II is the ability to mix models of computation.
These examples illustrate some of these capabilities.
<ul>

<li><i>Modal Models</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/de/demo/ModalModel/ModalModel.htm">
ModalModel</a>
<br>
A modal model is one whose behavior depends on its "mode"
of operation. A modal model in Ptolemy II heterogeneously combines the
<i>finite state machine</i> (FSM) domain
combined hierarchically with other models. A state in the FSM represents
a mode of operation, and can have a refinement that gives the behavior
in that mode.
The refinement can be another FSM or some other model using some other
Ptolemy domain. The <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/de/demo/ModalModel/ModalModel.htm">
ModalModel</a> example combines DE, FSM, and SDF to model a
system where regularly sampled signals are perturbed by irregular
events in time.


<br>

<li><i>Mixed-Signal Modeling</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/SigmaDelta/SigmaDelta.htm">
SigmaDelta</a> (see also
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Switch/Switch.htm">Switching Continuous</a>)
<br>
This example shows how to combine continuous-time modeling
with discrete-event modeling to get mixed-signal modeling.
The example models a MEMS accelerometer where a digital circuit
implements feedback control and A/D conversion (a design due to
Mark Lemkin).

</ul>
<h2>
<a name="basic">Basic Modeling Capabilities</a>
</h2>
Many common models of computation have been implemented in
Ptolemy II.  This section illustrates some of them.
<ul>

<li><i>Synchronous Dataflow</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/Spectrum/Spectrum.htm">
Spectrum</a> (See also
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/MaximumEntropySpectrum/MaximumEntropySpectrum.htm">MaximumEntropySpectrum</a>,
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/FourierSeries/FourierSeries.htm">FourierSeries</a>
<!-- , and
a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/SoundSpectrum/SoundSpectrum.htm" SoundSpectrum/a -->
)
<br> This example shows simple spectral estimation of the product
of two sinusoids in noise.  It illustrates models the use of synchronous dataflow (SDF) for signal
processing, and also shows many basic capabilities like
hierarchical models,
the Expression actor, and the signal processing actor library.
In SDF, the firing of actors is statically scheduled, and at the start of execution,
boundedness and deadlock conditions are checked.


<br>

<li><i>Continuous-Time Modeling</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Lorenz/Lorenz.htm">
Lorenz</a> (see also
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/SquareWave/SquareWave.htm">SquareWave</a>)
<br> This example shows a continuous-time
nonlinear feedback system that exhibits
chaotic behavior (this system is called a Lorenz attractor).
It illustrates the <i>continuous-time</i> (CT) domain,
which uses an underlying solver for ordinary differential equations.


<br>

<li><i>Discrete-Event Modeling</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/de/demo/Inspection/Inspection.htm">
Inspection</a> (see also
<a href="../../ptolemy/data/type/demo/Router/Router.htm">Router</a>
and <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/de/demo/TimingParadox/TimingParadox.htm">
TimingParadox</a>).
<br> This example shows
a famous paradox in probability called the inspection paradox.
It illustrates use of the <i>discrete-event</i> (DE) domain, where
events occur on a time line and are processed chronologically.
In this example, random
data stimulates a model and statistics are collected and reported
in various ways.


<br>

<li><i>Process Networks</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/pn/demo/OrderedMerge/OrderedMerge.htm">
OrderedMerge</a> (see also
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/pn/demo/NondeterministicMerge/NondeterministicMerge.htm">NondeterministicMerge</a>,
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/pn/demo/QR/QR.htm">QR</a>).
<br>
The process networks (PN) domain follows the semantics given by Kahn and MacQueen in 1977
to get processes with their own threads of control that send messages to one another
and achieve deterministic computation.
The <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/pn/demo/OrderedMerge/OrderedMerge.htm">
OrderedMerge</a> example implements an example given by Kahn and MacQueen
that calculates numbers whose prime
factors are 2, 3, and 5, only, and produces
them in an ordered sequence.
As of version 5.0, we have extended this model of computation with a
nondeterministic merge actor, illustrated in
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/pn/demo/NondeterministicMerge/NondeterministicMerge.htm">NondeterministicMerge</a>.

<br>

<!-- No CSP demos in 5.0.1 -->

<!--/vergilDocs-->
<!--Ptiny does not include ddf-->
<br>
<li> <i>Dynamic Dataflow</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/HanoiTower/HanoiTower.htm">HanoiTower</a> <font color="red">(Requires Java 3D)</font>
(see also
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/Eratosthenes/Eratosthenes.htm">Eratosthenes</a>,
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/IfThenElse/IfThenElse.htm">IfThenElse</a>,
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/Loop/Loop.htm">Loop</a>,
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/OrderedMerge/OrderedMerge.htm">OrderedMerge</a>,
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/RandomWalk/RandomWalk.htm">RandomWalk</a>)
<br>
In dynamic dataflow (DDF) models, actors are fired in response to available
input data. The schedule is dynamic and data dependent, and actors can
change their production and consumption rates in each firing.
Unlike synchronous dataflow, the DDF model of computation is Turing
complete, and questions of deadlock and boundedness are undecidable.
The <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ddf/demo/HanoiTower/HanoiTower.htm">HanoiTower</a>
example exploits this to give an algorithmic solution to the well-known
towers of Hanoi problem.

<br>
<li> <i>Heterochronous Dataflow</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/hdf/demo/Fibonacci/Fibonacci.htm">Fibonacci</a>
(see also
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/hdf/demo/Merge/Merge.htm">Merge</a>).
<br>
Heterochronous dataflow (HDF) is an extension of synchronous dataflow
(SDF) that permits dynamically changing production and consumption
patterns without sacrificing static scheduling. In SDF, the production
and consumption patterns of an actor are constant.
In HDF they are allowed to change between iterations of the HDF schedule.
Modal models can be used to change these patterns.
Although HDF can express many data-dependent computations that cannot
be represented by SDF, it is not Turing complete.  Consequently, deadlock
and boundedness remain decidable.
The <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/hdf/demo/Fibonacci/Fibonacci.htm">Fibonacci</a>
example uses this mechanism in a clever way to extract a Fibonacci sequence
from a counting sequence.

<!--sr does not get included in demosPtiny.htm -->
<li><i>Synchronous/Reactive Modeling</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sr/demo/TokenRing/TokenRing.htm">
TokenRing</a> (see also
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sr/demo/GuardedCount/GuardedCount.htm">
GuardedCount</a>).
<br>
The synchronous/reactive (SR) domain,
which is inspired by the synchronous languages Esterel, Lustre, and Signal,
realizes a concurrency model where actors react instantaneously and simultaneously
at ticks of a logical clock.
The <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sr/demo/TokenRing/TokenRing.htm">
TokenRing</a>
example uses the fixed-point semantics of SR to arbitrate access
to a shared medium using a token-ring protocol.

</ul>
<h2>
<a name="infrastructure">Modeling Infrastructure</a>
</h2>
Ptolemy II models are built on an underlying framework that provides a rich
set of generic capabilities that are available in all models.
This section illustrates that infrastructure.
<ul>

<li><i>The Type System</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/data/type/demo/Router/Router.htm">
Router</a>.
<br>
This model illustrates the very sophisticated type system
of Ptolemy II, where type constraints propagate transparently,
actors are polymorphic, and composite types such as records and
arrays are supported.
This example illustrates composite types, where records are
constructed out of tokens with various types. Here, a record
models a packet in a packet-switched network, where variable
delays may result in out-of-order arrival of packets.

<br>

<li><i>Expression Language</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ct/demo/Transmission/Transmission.htm">
Transmission</a>.
<br>
To simplify creating new components, Ptolemy II contains a functional
expression language.  The expression language is integrated with the
type system, allowing static type checking of polymorphic expressions
with few type annotations.  The expression language also allows new,
encapsulated functions, called function closures, to be defined and
passed as data.  This model illustrates how function closures can be
used to make models much more compact. 

<br>
<!--/vergilDocs-->
<!--We don't include hoc in Ptiny-->
<li><i>Higher-Order Components</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/demo/HocDE/HocDE.htm">HocDE</a>
(see also
<a href="../../ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/demo/MobileFunction/MobileFunction.htm">MobileFunction</a>,
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/MultipleRuns/MultipleRuns.htm">MultipleRuns</a>,
<a href="../../ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/demo/IterateOverArray/IterateOverArray.htm">IterateOverArray</a>,
<a href="../../ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/demo/DFTSubSet/DFTSubSet.htm">DFTSubSet</a>,
<!-- 
a href="../../ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/demo/ApplyFFT/ApplyFFT.htm" ApplyFFT /a
-->
).
<br>Higher-order components are components that operate on components.
The <a href="../../ptolemy/actor/lib/hoc/demo/HocDE/HocDE.htm">HocDE</a>
example contains a component that is a composite actor that
replicates itself some specified number of times to operate on
multiple channels of input.  This capability was created by
Zoltan Kemenczy and Sean Simmons, Research In Motion, Ltd.

<br>
<!--vergilDocs-->

<li><i>Interactive Signal Plotter</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/Sketch/Sketch.htm">Sketch</a>
(see also <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/FourierSeries/FourierSeries.htm">FourierSeries</a>).
<br>
This model illustrates the use of plotter to provide input
as well as rendering output from a model.  Right click and drag
on the plot to trace out a new signal. The model runs each time you
do this.

<br>

<!-- No Matlab Applets -->
<li><i>Matlab Integration</i>:
Ptolemy II include  the Matlab interface created by
Zoltan Kemenczy and Sean Simmons, of Research in Motion Ltd.,
to plot a 3-D surface. The Matlab interface requires that Matlab
be installed locally and because it uses JNI it requires signed
applets.

<br>

<li>
<i>Classes, subclasses, and inner classes</i>:
<!-- FIXME: Need ClassesIllustrated Applet -->
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/NoisySinewave/NoisySinewave.htm">
Noisy sinewaves</a>
(see also
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/RijndaelEncryption/RijndaelEncryption.htm">
Rijndael Encryption</a>).
<br>
Actor-oriented classes, subclasses, and
inner classes with inheritance are a special feature of Ptolemy II.
They provide modularity mechanisms analogous to those of object-oriented
design, but adapted to actor-oriented design. This capability permits, for
example, defining a class of models that can have instances and subclasses.
The instances and subclasses inherit all the features of the class, and
track any changes that are made to the class.

<br>

<li><i>Model Animations</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/actor/parameters/demo/Bouncer/Bouncer.htm">Bouncer</a>
(see also 
<!-- FIXME: no AnimateVergil applet? --> 
<!--/vergilDocs-->
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/wireless/demo/WirelessSoundDetection/WirelessSoundDetection.htm">
WirelessSoundDetection</a>
<!--vergilDocs-->
).
<br>
Ptolemy II models can, while executing, control their visual rendition
in Vergil, the visual editor for Ptolemy II.
In this example, a model alters the position in the Vergil diagram
of one of its own actors.

The <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/gr/demo/Pendulum/Pendulum.htm">

animated in the <i>graphics</i> (GR) domain, in which graphical components
can be assembled and dynamically manipulated.  Note that clicking
and dragging in the graphics window rotates the model.

<li><i>Statically Checked Units System</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/data/unit/demo/StaticUnits/StaticUnits.htm">
StaticUnits</a> (see also
<a href="../../ptolemy/data/unit/demo/Units/Units.htm">Units</a>, the
dynamically checked units system).
<br>
This model illustrates the use of the statically
checked units system. A unit system
defines a set of interrelated dimensions and measures. For example, in
the time dimension, we might have seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,
and fortnights. Ptolemy II includes two experimental units systems,
one that is statically checked and one that is dynamically checked.

<br>

<li><i>Network Integration</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/moml/demo/Networked/Networked.htm">
Networked</a>.<br>
This example illustrates that models may be defined in a networked,
distributed fashion.
This model contains a component that is defined on the Ptolemy project
website.  When you open the model, you will be alerted to the fact
that it requires loading a model definition from a remote source.
If you agree to proceed, then you will have a model with a remotely
defined component.  The component itself is at
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/xml/models/Waveform.xml">
http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/xml/models/Waveform.xml</a>.

<!-- 
You can open that definition by clicking on the hyperlink, or by
using the "Open URL" command in the File menu.

<li><i>Audio</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/actor/lib/javasound/demo/KarplusStrong/KarplusStrong.htm">
KarplusStrong</a> 

<!-- (see also a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/SoundSpectrum/SoundSpectrum.htm">SoundSpectrum/a). -->

<br>
Ptolemy II includes actors that interface to the audio system on
the executing machine, assuming it has one.
This example shows the Karplus-Strong algorithm, which synthesizes
a musical sound that closely resembles a plucked string instrument.
It illustrates the audio capabilities of Ptolemy II.

<br>

<li><i>Python Integration</i>:
<br>Python is a popular interpreted programming language that has
been integrated into Ptolemy II using the jython Java implementation of Python.
However, Python creates cache files on the local hard drive,
so we have no applets illustrating the interface.
<!--
This example shows that use of Python to alter a string entered by the user
to modify any word that begins with "t" so that it begins with "pt".
This leverages the excellent string processing capabilities in Python.
Python can also be used to prototype
actors by defining their functionality in Python.

<!--Ptiny does not include JAI or JMF-->

<li><i>Image and Video Processing</i>:
If you install the optional packages JAI (Java advanced imaging) and
JMF (Java media framework), then you can use a library of actors
that operates on images and video signals, including video captured
from a video camera.  At this time, we have no applets illustrating
these actors.

<li><i>Fixed-Point Arithmetic</i>:
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/FixFIR/FixFIR.htm">FixFIR</a>
(see also
<a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/FixPoint/FixPoint.htm">FixPoint</a>)
<br>
Ptolemy II data types include a fixed-point data type, where
a model can explicitly control the binary representation of numbers
and the mechanisms used to handle overflow and rounding.

</ul>

<h2>
<a name="libraries">Actor Libraries</a>

Ptolemy II includes several actor libraries that provide sophisticated
functions. A few of those are illustrated by the models here.
<ul>

<li><a href="../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/Array/Array.htm">Array</a>:
Actors that operate on matrices and arrays.

<h2>
<a name="experimental">Experimental Capabililties</a>
</h2>
<p>
Ptolemy II has a number of less well-developed experimental
capabilities that may continue to evolve over time.
These are illustrated in the following examples.

<ul>

<li> <a href="../../ptolemy/domains/ci/demo/Router/Router.htm">Push/Pull
Component Interaction</a>.
<br>
The CI (component interaction) domain models communication between
components that uses a combination of push and pull. This model
illustrates the use of these styles of communication to route packets
through queues using some policy that depends on the queue sizes.

<br>

<li>Cal: an interpreted actor definition language.
At this time, there are no Cal applets.

<br>

<li><a href="../../ptolemy/domains/dt/demo/Eye/Eye.htm">
Discrete-Time Models</a>.
<br> This example shows a simple pulse-amplitude modulation, physical
layer communication system.  It illustrates the <i>discrete-time</i> (DT)
domain, live parameter editing and
the scope-style plotter (which shows an eye diagram).
Note that discrete-time models can also be represented using the
SDF domain, which is not explicit about the passage of time.

<br>

<li> <a href="../../ptolemy/../doc/codegen.htm">
Code Generation</a>
<br>
This release includes a limited prototype of our code generation facility
that will generate .class files for non-hierarchical SDF models.
This example leads to more information about this capability.

<br>

<li><a href="../../ptolemy/domains/tm/demo/Controllers/Controllers.htm">
Timed Multitasking</a>.<br>
This example illustrates the <i>timed multitasking</i> (TM) domain,
which is inspired by the Giotto language, and has features of
priority-driven real-time operating systems. In this example,
two control systems share a computational resource. Depending
on the scheduling strategy chosen (preemptive or nonpreemptive)
and the priorities, the two control systems may be both stable,
or one may be stable, or the other may be stable.
