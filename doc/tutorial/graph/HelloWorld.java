 *  says "Hello World".
 *  <p>
 *  To place this attribute in model, in Vergil, select
 *  Graph->Instantiate Attribute and specify for the class
 *  name: doc.tutorial.graph.HelloWorld. Alternatively,
 *  you can paste the following MoML code into the model:
 *  <pre>
   <property name="HelloWorld" class="doc.tutorial.graph.HelloWorld">
     <property name="_location" class="ptolemy.kernel.util.Location" value="[100, 100]"/>
   </property>
 *  </pre>
 *  In the above, the _location property is necessary to ensure
 *  that Vergil shows an icon for the HelloWorld attribute.
 *  It specifies the location on the canvas where that icon
 *  should be placed.
