<h1>Ptolemy II User Interface</h1>
<p>
Ptolemy II includes an extensible and modular user interface
infrastructure.  A block diagram editor and a number of components
such as parameter editors, HTML viewers, text editors, and the like
can be configured and assembled in custom applets and applications.
A <i>configuration</i> is a Ptolemy II model, usually defined
in MoML, that defines the facilities that are included in a
particular application.  A full-featured block-diagram design
environment called Vergil is such a configuration.
