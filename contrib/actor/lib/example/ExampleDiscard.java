/**
 An example actor from the contrib directory.

 <p>A simple sink actor that consumes and discards input tokens.
 This actor is useful in situations where the value of an output is not
 needed, but for some reason, the output cannot be left unconnected.
 Also, when manipulating bus signals, this actor is useful if values
 in the middle of the bus need to be discarded.  Leaving the bus
 unconnected in the middle will not work because no channel is allocated
 to an unconnected relation in a bus.
