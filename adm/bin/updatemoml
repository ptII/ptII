# This script reads in one or more MoML files, filters each file
# and writes the results out
# Usage: updatemoml [-n] moml.xml [file2.xml . . .]
# -n means print the diffs only, do not update the original file

#
#  cd $PTII
#  $PTII/adm/bin/ptIItxtfiles | egrep '.xml$' > /tmp/x
# Remove the .xml files that declare libraries
#  grep -v 'lib/[a-z][^/]*.xml' /tmp/x > /tmp/x2
# updatemoml `cat /tmp/x2
