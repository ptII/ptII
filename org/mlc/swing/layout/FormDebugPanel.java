/**
 * [Taken from the FormLayout codebase. Hacked to work with @see ContainerLayout
    and deactivate() added.]
 <p>
 * A panel that paints grid bounds if and only if the panel's layout manager
 * is a {@link FormLayout}. You can tweak the debug paint process by setting
 * a custom grid color, painting optional diagonals and painting the grid
 * in the background.<p>
 *
 * This class is not intended to be extended. However, it is not
 * marked as <code>final</code> to allow users to subclass it for
 * debugging purposes. In general it is recommended to <em>use</em> JPanel
 * instances, not <em>extend</em> them. You can see this implementation style
 * in the Forms tutorial classes. Rarely there's a need to extend JPanel;
 * for example if you provide a custom behavior for
 * <code>#paintComponent</code> or <code>#updateUI</code>.
