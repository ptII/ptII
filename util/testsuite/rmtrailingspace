# This script can be used to fix many cvs managed files at once.
# Before running this script, you must:
# 1. Create a doit function that does the editing you want
# 2. Set up the files variable so it contains a list of the files
# 3. Set up a grep statement that will identify files you want to change
# 4. Adjust the log message for the cvs commit  command
# Then try out fix-files with the -n option, which only prints, but
# does not actually make the change.
#
# Usage: rmtrailinspace [-n] [-d]

printonly=no

# We don't use getopt here because it is not included in the basic
# cygwin bash download (12/01)
