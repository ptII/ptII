# This script can be used to fix many sccs managed files at once.
# Before running this script, you must:
# 1. Create a doit function that does the editing you want
# 2. Set up the files variable so it contains a list of the files
# 3. Set up a grep statement that will identify files you want to change
# 4. Adjust the log message for the sccs delget command
# Then try out fix-files with the -p option, which only prints, but
# does not actually make the change
# Usage: rmtrailinspace [-n] [-d]
