<h1>The text-editing Application</h1>

<p> This tutorial will explain how to create a simple text-editing
application.  It will cover how to take a document file (like TextDocument)
and assemble it with FileFilters, some premade actions handling those
documents, and manage a single view.

<p> To begin with, we need to be able to create new documents and add them
to the application.  Most of these operations are handled by actions that 
can be created using static methods in DefaultActions.  As an example, let's
look at the action for creating a new document. 
<pre>
    public static Action newAction(final Application app) {
        return new AbstractAction (NEW) {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                Document doc = app.getDocumentFactory().createDocument(app);
                app.addDocument(doc);
                app.displayDocument(doc);
                app.setCurrentDocument(doc);
            }
        };
    }
</pre>

<p> The static method is a factory for new actions that create new documents.  
Each new document is created by using the application's document factory.
and then added to the application and displayed.

<p> To see this action in the application, it has to be attached to some 
user interface component.  In the case of the this action, it is attached to
two components: a menu bar item and a tool bar button.  First let's look
at the menu bar item.

<pre>
    public void initializeMenuBar(JMenuBar menuBar) {
        Action action;
        JMenuItem item;

        // Create the File menu
        JMenu menuFile = new JMenu("File");
        menuFile.setMnemonic('F');
        menuBar.add(menuFile);

        action = DefaultActions.newAction(this);
        addAction(action);
        GUIUtilities.addMenuItem(menuFile, action, 'N', 
                                 "Create a new graph document");
        
        ...
    }
</pre>

<p> This method is called in the application constructor and it is responsible 
for populating the menu bar with item.  It also addes the actions to the
application so that the same action can be reused for a toolbar button.
GUIUtilities is a set of utility methods that are useful for supporting 
applications.  The addMenuItem method used here adds the action to the given
menu with an associated keyboard mnemonic and a tooltip.  It also sets
properties in the action so that the  and tooltip do not have to be 
specified later if the same action is used again.

<p> The toolbar is set up similarly, using a different GUIUtility method.
<pre>
    public void initializeToolBar (JToolBar tb) {
        Action action;
        RelativeBundle resources = getResources();

        action = getAction("New");
        GUIUtilities.addToolBarButton(tb, action, null,
                                      resources.getImageIcon("NewImage"));
        ...
    }
</pre>

<p> Notice here that we retrieve the menubar action from the application 
using the getAction() method.  The icon we use is also pulled out of a
property file.  In this case, the property file that we use is in 
the resource package, Defaults.properties.  The RelativeBundle class
uses a property file to avoid hard-coding the names of resources into the
application.  This allows us to easily change the icons later if we decide to.

<pre>
##
# Icon resources
#
OpenImage=img_open.gif
NewImage=img_new.gif
SaveImage=img_save.gif
</pre>

<p> These resources are defined in the AbstractApplication class, 
and can be used
by any subclass.  Applications can also define their own property files
in addition to the default, but we don't need to do that here.  For more
information about resources, see the RelativeBundle class and the getResource()
method in java.lang.Class.

<p> The rest of the ations for this application are added similarly.  
Most of the rest of them refer to a StoragePolicy object.  For instance, the
action for closing a document completely defers to the storage policy.

<pre>
    public static Action closeAction(final Application app) {
        return new AbstractAction (CLOSE) {
            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
                app.getStoragePolicy().close(app.getCurrentDocument());
            }
        };
    }
</pre>

<p> The storage policy may do many different things, depending on how
it is implemented.  It could close the document without saving, it could not
close the document at all, or it could popup a dialog, asking to confirm 
closing the document without saving it.  How do we initialize the storage 
policy?  The following piece of code is in the initializeApp() method:
<pre>
        try {
            DefaultStoragePolicy storage = new DefaultStoragePolicy();
            setStoragePolicy(storage);
        
            FileFilter ff = new FileFilter() {
                public boolean accept (File file) {
                    return GUIUtilities.getFileExtension(file).
                    toLowerCase().equals("txt");
                }
                public String getDescription () {
                    return "Text files";
                }
            };
            JFileChooser fc;      
            fc = storage.getOpenFileChooser();
            fc.addChoosableFileFilter(ff);
            fc.setFileFilter(ff);
            
            fc = storage.getSaveFileChooser();
            fc.addChoosableFileFilter(ff);
            fc.setFileFilter(ff);
        } catch (SecurityException ex) {
            // FIXME: create a new "NoStoragePolicy"
        }
</pre>

<p> In this case, we are using a DefaultStoragePolicy, which generally uses
a "confirmation dialog" style of implementing each of its operations.  The 
DefaultStoragePolicy class contains two file choosers, one for opening 
files and one for saving files.  This allows 
loading files from one place and saving them to another.  It also allows the
application to understand two different sets of document types for opening 
and saving.  The types of documents that are understood are set using the 
FileFilter.  The security exception is caught so that the application will
work within an applet, which is generally unable to access the local file
system.  In that case, we switch to using a storage policy which disallows 
persistent storage.

<p> So now that we've got documents into our application, how do we deal with
creating views for them?  This tutorial contains reference 
to two private variables.  One is a reference to the single shared view, 
and the other is a referece to the document that is currently
displayed in the view.  These variables are first initialized in the
constructor:

<pre>
        _editorPane = new JEditorPane();        
        context.getContentPane().add(new JScrollPane(_editorPane));
        _displayedDocument = null;
        displayDocument(getCurrentDocument());
</pre>

The displayDocument method updates the text in the editor pane with the
text of the given document.  At this point, however, the application
contains no documents so the current document is null.  In this case the 
displayDocument method clears the editorPane and sets it to not be editable.

<p> So what happens when a document is added to or removed from 
the application?  Well, we want to get the current document and display it.
When a document is added or removed, that call should always be followed
by a call to set the current document.  We will detect that call by adding
a listener to the list of documents, and then displaying the current document.

<pre>
          addDocumentListener(new ListDataListener() {
            public void contentsChanged(ListDataEvent e) {
                System.out.println("current document = " +
                                   getCurrentDocument());
                displayDocument(getCurrentDocument());
            }
            public void intervalAdded(ListDataEvent e) {
            }
            public void intervalRemoved(ListDataEvent e) {
            }
        });
</pre>

<p> We also want to be sure to update the text in the document whenever any
change is made to the view in the editor pane.   To accomplish this we will
add another listener to the editor pane that will update the text of
the current document.

<pre>        
        _editorPane.getDocument().addDocumentListener(new DocumentListener() {
            public void changedUpdate(DocumentEvent e) {
                if(_displayedDocument != null)
                    _displayedDocument.setText(_editorPane.getText());
            }
            ...
        });
</pre>
