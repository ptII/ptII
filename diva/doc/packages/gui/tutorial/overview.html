<h1>Creating an Application</h1>

<p> The first decision that is often made when designing an application in 
Java is to choose a context for the application to be run in; will it be an
applet or a command-line application?  Unfortunately, the Swing infrstracture
for these two classes is rather fragmented, and supporting both in a simple
way that does not require much code duplication is a difficult thing.  An
important part of this package is the AppContext interface, which contains
most of the functionality that JApplet and JFrame have in common.  By
designing around this interface, essentially the same application code can run
transparently in an Applet or as a traditional command-line application!

<p> We view an application as an organized way of creating and managing
documents and views for those documents.  A document represents some 
largely self-contained piece of data and (usually) some way to
persistently store that data (such as a document file).  The key to
managing documents is to provide a storage policy that consistently
stores and retrieves those documents, regardless of the data.  
Some simple applications might contain only one document and require only
simple logic to manage the document view(s).  More 
complex applications that manage many documents using internal 
frames need to be significantly more sophisticated in managing 
document views.  

<p> The Diva GUI framework is centered around the AppContext, Application,
Document, and StoragePolicy interfaces.  These interfaces are designed to
mirror the above ideas.  Basic implementations of these interfaces allow
applications to be up and running fairly quickly.  To illustrate the basic 
application infrastructure, we are going to
walk you through the design of a simple text-editing application.  It is 
never going to replace Emacs, but it contains the important aspects of
assembling an application.  I assembled these examples from bits and pieces 
of code in a few hours while sitting on the beach.  Hopefully you will be
able to take these simple tutorials and do basically the same thing with
your application.
