A set of tutorials for the Diva canvas. Each class in this package
illustrates how to use one key aspect of the canvas. Each class is
self-contained, so that you can see all of the code in one place, and
as short as possible given the constraints of making them somewhat
realistic.  The classes are further broken into small methods, each
illustrating one key point.

<P>
All of the tutorials show some common code in the constructor
that creates an instance of JCanvas and places it into a
frame. The code is:

<pre>
  canvas = new JCanvas();
  graphicsPane = (GraphicsPane)canvas.getCanvasPane();

  BasicFrame frame = new BasicFrame("Simple canvas tutorial", canvas);
  frame.setSize(600,400);
  frame.setVisible(true);
</pre>

<P>
(Where <B>canvas</B> and <B>graphicsPane</B> are private variables of
the class.)  Every JCanvas contains a top-level canvas pane, which in
turn contains layers. By default, the top-level pane is an instance of
GraphicsPane.  BasicFrame is part of the <a
href="../../gui/package-summary.html">diva.gui</a> package and contains the
JCanvas in its content pane.

<p>
To run a particular tutorial, simply move to the
<B>diva/canvas/tutorial</B> directory and type:

<pre>
  make FigureTutorial
</pre>

(where FigureTutorial is replaced by the class you want to run).
A Java window will appear where you can see and manipulate the
figures.
