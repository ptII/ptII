/** An example showing how to make figures draggable with interactors.
 *
 * <img src="doc-files/DragTutorial.gif" align="right">
 *
 * Each figure on the canvas can have its
 * interactor set or read with the methods setInteractor()
 * and getInteractor(). The interactor answers the
 * question "What does this figure do when I mouse on it?" In this
 * example, what the figure does is follow the mouse.
 *
 * <p>
 * To make a figure draggable, we create an instance of
 * DragInteractor and attach it to the figure, like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Interactor dragger = new DragInteractor();
 *     dragger.setMouseFilter(MouseFilter.defaultFilter);
 *
 *     BasicFigure blue = new BasicRectangle(10.0,10.0,50.0,50.0,Color.blue);
 *     layer.add(blue);
 *     blue.setInteractor(dragger);
 * </pre>
 *
 * The mouse filter is used to tell the interactor whether or
 * not to respond to events. The default mouse filter used here is
 * button 1 with no modifiers.
 *
 * <p> Each interactor can also have a set of <i>constraints</i> added to
 * it. In this example, we have created an instance of
 * BoundedDragInteractor, which adds a constraint to itself in its
 * constructor.  BoundedDragInteractor always keeps figures that it is
 * dragging within a rectangular region -- in our example, the region is
 * shown by the grey line.
 *
 * <p> One point to note about interactors. In general, many figures will
 * share a single interactor. For example, all nodes in a graph editor
 * might reference the "node interactor" object. This strategy allows the
 * behaviour of a whole set of figures to be changed together (by
 * changing the behaviour of the interactor).
