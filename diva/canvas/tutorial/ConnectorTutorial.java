/** This tutorial shows how to use Connectors.
 *
 * <img src="doc-files/ConnectorTutorial.gif" align="right">
 *
 * Connectors are objects
 * that connect locations on two different figures. These locations
 * are identified by objects called Sites, which represents points
 * such as the north-west corner of a rectangle, or a vertex of a
 * poly-line. In general, sites can be anywhere on a figure, and
 * specific figure classes have methods to access their sites.  (See
 * the SitesTutorial for more examples of Sites.)
 *
 * <p> Once a Connector is connected between two sites, it is easy to make
 * it appear as though the Connector is "glued" to the figures
 * containing the sites. Any code that moves or changes one of the two
 * figure only needs to call one of route(), reroute(), headMoved(),
 * or tailMoved(), and the connector will redraw itself between the
 * sites.
 *
 * <p>
 * The code to create a connector looks like this:
 * <pre>
 *     Site a = figureA.getE();
 *     Site b = figureB.getN();
 *     connectorA = new StraightConnector(a, b);
 *     layer.add(connectorA);
 * </pre>
 *
 * (Where the methods getE() and getN() are methods on some figure
 * that return Sites -- in this case, on the east and north edges
 * of the respective figures.)
 *
 * <p> In general, there can be arbitrarily many different kinds of
 * connector. The Diva canvas currently provides two: one that simply
 * draws a straight line between the two sites, and one that draws a
 * "manhattan" routing between the two sites. Each of these also
 * accepts an object on each end that will draw a decoration such as
 * an arrow-head or a circle at the attachment point.  For example,
 * we can add an arrowhead to the connector with:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Arrowhead arrow = new Arrowhead(b.getX(), b.getY(), b.getNormal());
 *     connectorA.setHeadEnd(arrow);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Once a Connector is connected between two sites, it is easy to make it
 * appear as though the Connector is "glued" to the figures containing
 * the sites. Any code that moves or changes one of the two figure needs
 * to call one of the methods route(), reroute(), headMoved(), or
 * tailMoved() on the connector, and the connector will redraw itself
 * between the sites. In this example, we have set up a DragInteractor
 * to move the two rectangles shown in the image above. To also reroute
 * the connectors when either changes, we add a layer listener to the
 * interactor.  After the interactor has handled a mouse event, it passes
 * the event on to this listener.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     DragInteractor i = controller.getDragInteractor();
 *     i.addLayerListener(new LayerAdapter () {
 *         public void mouseDragged (LayerEvent e) {
 *             connectorA.reroute();
 *             connectorB.reroute();
 *         }
 *     });
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * When a connector is selected, it gets a grab-handle on either end, which
 * can be grabbed to allow the connector to be disconnected from
 * the figure and reconnected to another. Although the code is
 * a little convoluted, the essence of it is this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     SelectionInteractor ci = new SelectionInteractor(si.getSelectionModel());
 *     connectorA.setInteractor(ci);
 *     connectorB.setInteractor(ci);
 *
 *     ConnectorManipulator manipulator = new ConnectorManipulator();
 *     manipulator.setSnapHalo(4.0);
 *     manipulator.setConnectorTarget(new SRTarget());
 *     ci.setPrototypeDecorator(manipulator);
 * </pre>
 *
 * This code first creates an instance of SelectionInteractor,
 * which it sets as the interactor for the connectors. It then creates an
 * instance of ConnectorManipulator, and tell the interactor that when a
 * connector is selected, it should create a copy of the manipulator and
 * wrap it around the connector. The manipulator highlights the connector
 * with grab handles when the connector is selected.
 *
 * <p> Notice that in this code there are actually two selection interactors,
 * one for the rectangles and one for the connectors.  They are linked by having
 * the same selection model.  One effect that this has is that selecting a
 * rectangle when a connector is already selected will deselect the connector.
 * If there were two selection models then connectors and rectangles could
 * be selected entirely independently from each other.
 *
 * <p> The SRTarget in the above code is an inner class that implements
 * the ConnectorTarget interface. This class is used by the
 * ConnectorManipulator when trying to find a good place to connect
 * to. In this example, the target is returning sites on the four edges
 * of the rectangles, which is why the connectors snap to those points.
