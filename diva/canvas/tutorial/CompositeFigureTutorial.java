/**
 * This tutorial demonstrates how to use composite figures.
 * <img src="doc-files/CompositeFigureTutorial.gif" align="right">
 *
 * <P>
 * It instantiates a composite figure which contains a
 * square (which represents the body of a component) and
 * four circles (which represents "ports" on the component).
 * The ports can be moved and scaled independently of the body, and
 * when the body is scaled, the ports are scaled proportionally.
 *
 * <p>
 * In general, it would be better to create a custom class for something
 * like a component with port -- the purpose here is simply
 * to illustrate how to use this class. The way that the composite figure
 * is created is straight-forward:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     CompositeFigure tc = new CompositeFigure();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <P> Adding child figures to the composite figure is also straight-forward.
 * For example,
 * <pre>
 *     Figure p1 = new BasicEllipse(150.0, 100.0, 20.0, 20.0, Color.red);
 *     p1.translate(-10,-10);
 *     tc.add(p1);
 * </pre>
 *
 * (The call to translate is there simply because it was easier to
 * figure out the coordinates of all the figures relative to their centers.
 * The translate() moves the center to the coordinates set in
 * the call to the constructor.)
 *
 * <p>
 * In this tutorial we also introduce the notion of controllers and
 * interactors. Any but the simplest interactive graphical applications
 * should have a <i>controller</i> object that takes care of managing
 * user interaction.  The class
 * <b>diva.canvas.toolbox.BasicController</b> is a very basic interaction
 * controller that we use in some of the tutorials. It contains an object
 * called a DragInteractor that is used to move figures about on the
 * screen:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     BasicController controller = new BasicController(graphicsPane);
 *     Interactor defaultInteractor = controller.getSelectionInteractor();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * To make each figure respond to the mouse, we just give it the
 * interactor. For example,
 *
 * <pre>
 *     p1.setInteractor(defaultInteractor);
 * </pre>
 *
 * In this example, an interactor is set up on each port so that they
 * can be dragged independently, and an interactor is set up on
 * the composite figure itself, so dragging on any figure that is
 * not part of the background itself will drag the whole figure and
 * its contents.
