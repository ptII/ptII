/** An example showing how to make custom figures.
 *
 * <p>
 * <img src="doc-files/FigureTutorial.gif" align="right">
 *
 * Although the Diva Canvas provides a number of pre-built concrete
 * figures in <b>diva.canvas.toolbox</b> (BasicFigure is used in many
 * of the examples), you will in general want to define your own
 * Figure classes. The Diva Canvas deliberately does not attempt to
 * hide the power of the Java2D API, but instead to augment it. This
 * means that anything but the simplest types of Figure require some
 * knowledge of Java2D.
 *
 * <p> In general, defining a completely new type of Figure means
 * implementing the Figure interface. However, it is usually simpler
 * just to subclass the AbstractFigure class and override at least the
 * methods getShape(), transform(), and paint(). The example in this
 * file does that to create a new leaf figure.
 *
 * Our example (see the source file for the complete code) extends
 * AbstractFigure:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public class CustomRectangle extends AbstractFigure {
 *         private Rectangle2D _bounds;
 *         public CustomRectangle (
 *                 double x, double y,
 *                 double width, double height) {
 *             _bounds = new Rectangle2D.Double(x,y,width,height);
 *         }
 *
 *         ....
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p> The appearance of this figure is shown in the image above (the
 * yellow outline is the highlighting, and is not part of this figure).
 * It has a fill, a 1-point black outline, and some additional stuff
 * drawn on it.
 *
 * <p>
 * Let's look at the individual methods of this class. The getBounds()
 * method gets the shape of the figure's stroke outline, and then
 * takes the bounding box of that shape. (If we were to simply return
 * <b>_bounds</b>, part of the outline would fall outside the bounding
 * box and we would get "dirt" on the screen when we moved the figure.)
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public Rectangle2D getBounds () {
 *         Stroke s = new BasicStroke(1.0f);
 *         return s.createStrokedShape(_bounds).getBounds2D();
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The getShape() method simply returns the outline rectangle. getShape()
 * is used by methods in the Diva canvas to do things like place grab-handles
 * on figures and to put highlights around them:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public Shape getShape () {
 *         return _bounds;
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The paint() method is where most of the work (in this example) is
 * done. Note that the argument is an instance of
 * <b>java.awt.Graphics2D</b>.  This method will be called in the event
 * thread whenever AWT redraws the JCanvas that contains this figure.
 * We won't show all of this method here, just the start:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public void paint (Graphics2D g) {
 *         Stroke s = new BasicStroke(1.0f);
 *         g.setStroke(s);
 *         g.setPaint(Color.blue);
 *         g.fill(_bounds);
 *         g.setPaint(Color.black);
 *         g.draw(_bounds);
 *
 *         ....
 *      }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Finally, the transform() method transforms the figure. This method
 * is used whenever a figure is scaled or moved. Note that this code
 * calls the repaint() method before and after transforming the figure shape.
 * This ensures that the screen is properly redrawn.
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public void transform (AffineTransform at) {
 *         repaint();
 *         _bounds = (Rectangle2D) CanvasUtilities.transform(_bounds, at);
 *         repaint();
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * There are other methods that may need to be over-ridden, depending
 * on what exactly your figure class does. For more information on the
 * methods of Figure, see the API documentation.
 *
 * <p>
 * A simpler, although somewhat slower executing, way to specify the look of a
 * figure is to create a GIF file that looks like the figure.
 * The GIF file can be loaded into an Image and the Image embedded
 * into a figure.   An ImageFigure does exactly this.
 *
 * <pre>
 *         // Create an image figure and make it draggable
 *         Image img = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage(IMAGE_FILE_NAME);
 *         MediaTracker tracker = new MediaTracker(canvas);
 *         tracker.addImage(img,0);
 *         try {
 *             tracker.waitForID(0);
 *         }
 *         catch (InterruptedException e) {
 *             System.err.println(e + "... in FigureTutorial");
 *         }
 *         ImageFigure imgFig = new ImageFigure(img);
 *         imgFig.translate(300,100);
 *         layer.add(imgFig);
 *         imgFig.setInteractor(defaultInteractor);
 * </pre>
 *
 * The media tracker is responsible for waiting for the image to be completely
 * loaded from the file before creating the ImageFigure.  After being created,
 * the ImageFigure can be used exactly like other figures.
 *
 * <p> There are also other ways of creating new Figure classes.
 * You can subclass AbstractFigureContainer to produce a new figure
 * class that contains other figures. You can also subclass FigureWrapper
 * to add application-specific behavior to an existing figure class
 * by "wrapping" it.
