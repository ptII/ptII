/** This tutorial shows how to make custom figures that contain
 * their own TransformContext.
 *
 * <img src="doc-files/TransformedFigureTutorial.gif" align="right">
 *
 * In the FigureTutorial class, we
 * showed how to make a custom figure, and how to transform the
 * various 2D shapes in the paint() method. Here, we will use
 * an AffineTransform to do the same thing. This technique is
 * a little more work to figure out how to do, but it's probably
 * better if your figure has more than a couple of Shapes in it.
 *
 * <p> Transforms are a little tricky to get right, so the Diva
 * Canvas provides a class, TransformContext, that you need to use
 * to give a figure its own transform. Each instance of TransformContext
 * contains a single AffineTransform, and a bunch of methods that
 * deal with it.
 *
 * <p> The start of the CloudFigure class contains this code:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     private TransformContext _transformContext;
 *     private Rectangle2D _cachedBounds = null;
 *     private Shape _cachedShape = null;
 *
 *     public CloudFigure (
 *             double x, double y,
 *             double width, double height ) {
 *
 *         _transformContext = new TransformContext(this);
 *         AffineTransform at = _transformContext.getTransform();
 *         at.translate(x,y);
 *         at.scale(width/100, height/100);
 *         _transformContext.invalidateCache();
 *
 *         ....
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * The initial shape of this figure is in fact a "cloud" shape
 * that is located at (0,0) and is 100 units on each side. The
 * internal transform is therefore initialized to scale this
 * shape to the requested coordinates.
 *
 * <p>
 * Now, because the shape of this figure is fairly expensive to
 * transform, the two instance variables <b>_cachedBounds</b> and
 * <b>_cachedShape</b> store the bounds and shape for the current
 * transform. If you look at the source code for this class, you will see
 * that these are created and remembered in getBounds() and
 * getShape(). In getShape(), for example, the internally-stored
 * shape needs to be transformed into "external" coordinates:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public Shape getShape () {
 *         if (_cachedShape == null) {
 *             AffineTransform at = _transformContext.getTransform();
 *             _cachedShape = at.createTransformedShape(_shape);
 *         }
 *         return _cachedShape;
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Whenever the transform changes, these shapes must be cleared.
 * For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public void transform (AffineTransform at) {
 *         repaint();
 *         _cachedShape = null;
 *         _cachedBounds = null;
 *         _transformContext.preConcatenate(at);
 *         repaint();
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The only other interesting thing about this class is the
 * paint() method. Because paint() is called recursively down
 * the tree of figures, the TransformContext class provides
 * two methods that "stack" transform contexts as the tree
 * is traversed. The paint() method calls push() and pop()
 * before and after painting the figure's contents:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     public void paint (Graphics2D g) {
 *         _transformContext.push(g);
 *
 *         ....
 *         // Paint the big cloud
 *         AlphaComposite c = AlphaComposite.getInstance(
 *                 AlphaComposite.SRC_OVER,0.5f);
 *         g.setComposite(c);
 *         g.setPaint(Color.magenta);
 *         g.fill(_shape);
 *
 *         ....
 *         _transformContext.pop(g);
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * That's about all that's needed to use transform contexts
 * in a figure.
