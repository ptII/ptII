/** The class representing mouse events in layers. This class extends
 * the AWT MouseEvent class, but adds the notion of floating-point
 * coordinates and a "layer source" and "figure source" as well as
 * a component source.
 * Any code that processes a LayerEvent should be sure to
 * use the methods <b>getLayerX</b>, <b>getLayerY</b>,
 * <b>getLayerPoint</b>, instead of the inherited methods <b>getX</b>,
 * <b>getY</b>, <b>getPoint</b>. (Originally, this class was designed
 * to inherit from the AWT InputEvent class, which would have avoided
 * the awkwardness of having two sets of coordinates in the same event
 * object. This wasn't possible because InputEvent has only one
 * package-scope constructor, and hence cannot be subclassed outside
 * the AWT package.)
