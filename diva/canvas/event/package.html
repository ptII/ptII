Event-handling support for the Diva canvas.  Because the canvas pane
and layers in Diva implement an independent, floating-point,
coordinate system, this package has to re-implement some of the basic
AWT support for mouse events.  A new event type, <b>LayerEvent</b>,
which subclasses <b>java.awt.event.MouseEvent</b>, represents on
layers and on graphical figures. It contains both the original
screen coordinates of the mouse event and those coordinates 
translated unto the coordinate system of the containing canvas pane.

<p> Corresponding to the layer event class are two new listener
classes, <B>LayerListener</b> and <b>LayerMotionListener</b>.  The
former handles mouse press, drag, and release events, and the latter
mouse enter, motion, and leave events. This separation avoid needless
inefficiency in interactive canvases. Events can be received from
Figure objects, and from the special-purpose <b>EventLayer</b>, which
dispatches any events it received to its listeners.

<p> An additional class, <b>EventDispatcher</b> is used to dispatch
events to attached listeners. This class is used by the top-level
package to group figures into common event-handling classes.
