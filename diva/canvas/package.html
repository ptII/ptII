<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

A Java2D structured graphics package. The Diva
canvas is designed to be a useful construction toolkit for interactive
2D editors, viewers, and visualization tools.  It aims to be useful
and flexible without constraining clients to conventional user
interface idioms.

<p>
This top-level package, <b>diva.canvas</b>, provides the
essential infrastructure of the canvas. Other sub-packages,
with the exception of <b>diva.canvas.event</b> (which is
also essential) provide additional functionality, complexity, 
or ease-of-use of the basic infrastructure.

<p>
This package provides:

<ul>
<li> A Swing component, <b>JCanvas</b>.

<li> A layered canvas pane, <b>CanvasPane</b>, and a 
basic implementation, <b>BasicCanvasPane</b>, which 
provide a screen-independent coordinate system.

<li> A set of layers, including <b>CanvasLayer</b>
and <b>FigureLayer</b>, which map onto a canvas pane
and which display graphics or handle events.

<li> A set of abstract and concrete persistent object classes,
including <b>Figure</b>, <b>LeafFigure</b>, <b>SimpleFigure</b>,
and <b>CompositeFigure</b>.

<li> Various support classes and interfaces.

</ul>
