/** A LabelWrapper is a figure that attaches a label to some other figure.
 * The location at which the label is attached can (in this class) be
 * set to the center or to any of the four edges or corners of the
 * bounding box. (Maybe later we'll figure out a way to have the label
 * locate at a site.) In addition, the anchor and padding attributes
 * of the figure itself can be used to adjust the label location relative
 * to the anchoring point on the main figure.
 *
 * <P> Note that this class is intended for use in simple applications
 * where a simple label is attached to something. For more complex
 * applications, such as attaching multiple labels, you will need
 * to implement your own class.
