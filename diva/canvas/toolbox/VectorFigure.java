/** A VectorFigure is a figure containing a list of objects that
 * are drawn to produce the figure.
 *
 * The list of objects that are drawn
 * includes both geometric objects and drawing control objects.
 * Specifically:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Shape: any Shape is drawn as determine by the current fill and line
 *      styles.
 * <li> Stroke, Paint, Composite: any subsequent shapes are drawn using
 *      this object set appropriately in the graphics object
 * <li> Figure: Any other Figure can be drawn as well, thus allowing
 *      hierarchical drawing. Note, however, that figures drawn inside
 *      are NOT able to detect events. After the figure is drawn, the
 *      style, stroke, etc, will be reser to the default
 * </ul>
 *
 * Strings are not currently supported, but will be soon. Transforms
 * are not supported, but may be at some time in the future.
 *
 * The figure is switched between line drawing mode and filling mode
 * with the calls lineMode() and fillMode(). The default mode
 * is line drawing with a 1-pixel black stroke.
