/** A Connector that draws itself in an arc. The connector
 * draws itself approximately through the center of the figures
 * that own the sites to which it is connected. The curvature of the
 * arc can be specified in one of two ways, depending on which
 * variable of the arc's shape remain constant as the distance
 * between the two figures at the ends of the arc is varied:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> Constant incident angle: The angle at which the arc connects
 * to the figure remains constant. This is the default behaviour,
 * and the default angle is 45 degrees.
 *
 * <li> Constant displacement at the maximum arc point, from
 * the straight line drawn between the two end points of the
 * connector. The default displacement is 20 (not for any good reason,
 * but is has to be something...).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <P>Currently, only the first is supported.
 *
 * <p> The connector uses an instance of PaintedPath to draw itself,
 * so see that class for a more detailed description of the paint- and
 * stroke-related methods.
