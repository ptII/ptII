/** A CompositeFigure is a figure that contains a set of child
 * figures.  It uses a ZList as the internal representation of its
 * children, and implements wrappers for many of the z-list methods to
 * provide flexible access to the contained figures. Note that this
 * class exposes the ability to add and remove children by any client,
 * and is thus intended for use in situations in which the number of
 * child figures is either large or unpredictable. For applications in
 * which the number of children is smaller and predictable, and more
 * restricted access to the children is require, applications should
 * implement a custom subclass of AbstractFigureContainer. For an
 * example, see diva.canvas.toolbox.IconFigure.
