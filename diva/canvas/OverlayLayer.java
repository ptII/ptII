/**
 * OutlineLayer is a layer that is used to display the grey
 * figures commonly used for drag-selection, reshaping items,
 * and so on. It can have shapes added to it, which are all drawn
 * in outline in grey (by default -- the color can be changed).
 * There is no concept of a display list or z-depth in this
 * layer, as all shapes are drawn in exactly the same color.
 *
 * <P> Although currently it does not do so, this class
 * will become optimized so that repaints of this layer do not
 * require a repaint of backing layers.
