/** A ZList is an interface for objects that contain an ordered list
 * of figures in z-order. In addition to the methods inherited from
 * FigureChildren, ZList has methods for reordering figures in the
 * list, and in the future may have methods for locating objects in 2D
 * space. This interface is used to isolate the implementation of
 * figure containers from the z-list, to allow future optimization of
 * the z-list implementation.
 *
 * This interface tries to mimic the AWT Container and Swing
 * JLayerPane interfaces where possible. Unfortunately, these two
 * classes differ on the relation between list ordering and display
 * ordering, so we have chosen to use the AWT Container order
 * (high-numbered elements are displayed below lower-numbered
 * elements), since we thought it would make using the <b>add</b>
 * method less
 * error-prone.
