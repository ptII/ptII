The library of interactors and other interaction support. This package
is built on top of the basic event-handling provided by
diva.canvas.event.

<p> An interactor is an object that captures the notion of the
interaction that a figure performs.  For example, in a simple graph
editor I might create two interactors: one for edges and one for
nodes. Each edge object has a pointer to the edge interactor (using
the method setInteractor()), and the nodes similarly have pointers to
the node interactor.

<p>This means several things. First, we have a clear way to make all
edges and nodes (for example) behave in the same way. Second, we can
change the behaviour of all nodes or edges by modifying the one
interactor. Third, we can build re-usable interaction styles as
interactors.
