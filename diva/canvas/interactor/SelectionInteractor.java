/**
 * A SelectionInteractor is attached to an object that can be put

 * is a selection model, which is the selection that figures
 * are added to or removed from.
 *
 * When a mouse pressed event has occurred, all figures associated
 * with the same SelectionModel will be unselected before the new
 * one is selected.  So, to make sure only one figure is selected
 * at a time, do this:
 * SelectionModel m = new SelectionModel();
 * SelectionInteractor s1 = new SelectionInteractor(m);
 * SelectionInteractor s2 = new SelectionInteractor(m);
 *
 * <p> When an item is selected, events are then forwarded to
 * other interactors. If, however, the clicked-on figure has
 * just been removed from the figure, do not forward events.
