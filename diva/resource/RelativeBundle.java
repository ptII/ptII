 * let the class-loaders find the resource for you.
 * <li> "override" other resource bundles. Thus, an abstract application
 * could have a set of default resources, and a particular application
 * could add its own resources to override the defaults where appropriate.

     * must be such that the resource paths in the properties file
     * ("baseName.properties") are relative to the package containing
     * that class.
     *
     * For example, you could create a default Bundle and override
     * it as follows:
     * <pre>
     *   RelativeBundle default = new diva.resource.Default();
     *   RelativeBundle resource = new RelativeBundle(
     *       "mypackage.resource.MyResources", getClass(), default);

     * would contain resource such as
     * <pre>
     *    LoadImage = resources/load.gif
     *    SaveImage = resources/save.gif
     * </pre>
     *
     * <P>If you don't mind cluttering up your source directory
     * with resource files, then it's probably better to put the
     * resource file in the same directory as the application classes,
     * so the properties files doesn't need the "resources/" strings.
