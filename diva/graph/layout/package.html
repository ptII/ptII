<P>A graph layout package which provides static and incremental node
layout and edge routing facilities. This package depends on the
package <B>diva.graph.model</B> for defining a graph's topology and
graph update events, but has no dependency on the specific
implementation of the graph's visual representation. It states certain
assumptions about information that it needs to complete its layout
(e.g. a viewport, bounding boxes for nodes, and paths for edges)
through the interfaces <FONT FACE="Courier New,
Courier">LayoutEnvironment</FONT>, <FONT FACE="Courier New,
Courier">LayoutNode</FONT>, <FONT FACE="Courier New,
Courier">LayoutEdge</FONT>, and <FONT FACE="Courier New,
Courier">PathLayoutEdge</FONT>.  The <B>diva.graph</B> package
satisfies these assumptions.</P>

<P>The interfaces for layout engines are specified by <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">StaticLayout</FONT> and
<FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">IncrementalLayout</FONT>, which perform static and incremental layout on the
graph, respectively. Static layouts traverse the graph structure and perform layout from scratch, ignoring the
previous positions of the nodes in the graphs.  Incremental layouts are performed as the graph topology is modified
and attempt to preserve the visual continuity of the layout.  They are notified of graph modifications via the
<FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">GraphListener</FONT> interface.</P>

<P>Edge routing is specified by the interfaces <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">StaticPathRouter</FONT> and <FONT
FACE="Courier New, Courier">DynamicPathRouter</FONT> which are somewhat analogous to the two flavors of layout.
The <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">StaticPathRouter</FONT> interface specifies a routing engine that can route
a path edge between two nodes statically (i.e. from scratch, ignoring the previous positions of the endpoint nodes);
the <FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">DynamicPathRouter</FONT> specifies a routing engine that can dynamically
adjust an already-routed path edge as one of its endpoint-nodes is moved (e.g. by the user dragging a node around).</P>

<P><B><I>NOTE:</I></B><I> How do we handle users interactively editing the middle of an edge's </I><B>path</B><I>
and collapsing multiple edges?</I>
