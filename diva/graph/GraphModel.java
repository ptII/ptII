/**
 * A graph model is an abstraction of a graph implementation and a
 * registration point for GraphListeners. A graph model contains
 * a root graph which in turn contains nodes, composite nodes (i.e.
 * nodes that contain other nodes), and edges between nodes. <p>
 *
 * A graph model provides read-only access to a graph.  The getRoot()
 * method provides access to the root of a (possibly hierarchically
 * nested) graph.  Given that object, nodes() returns an iterator
 * over that graphs contents, and inEdges() and outEdges() can be used
 * to traverse edges.  get/setVisited() are utility functions to help
 * with graph traversals. <p>
 *
 * For read-write access to the graph, use the sub-interface
 * MutableGraphModel.
