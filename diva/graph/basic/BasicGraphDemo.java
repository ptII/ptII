/**
 * The graph demo demonstrates basic graph editing and layout
 * functionality, illustrates the key points of the graph
 * architecture. A graph is constructed programmatically, and can then
 * be edited interactively by the user. There are two views of the
 * graph: one which has an automatic layout algorithm applied each
 * time a new node is added, and one which uses a random or
 * user-driven layout. <p>
 *
 * The interaction and display in the graph editor, although currently
 * fairly simple, uses the features of the Diva canvas to good
 * effect. The use of two views of the graph highlights the
 * Swing-style model-view-controller architecture of the graph
 * package.
