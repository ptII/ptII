/**
 * This example shows three alternatives to display a prepopulated
 * graph model in a window.  Prepopulated means that there are
 * already nodes in the model before the model was placed in a
 * GraphPane. There was a problem in the initial release which made
 * this break. That problem has been fixed and it will just work now,
 * except for one little gotcha, which is if you set the model while
 * the window is closed, the GraphPane thinks its size is 0x0, so the
 * nodes all get layed out in the upper-left corner of the canvas. The
 * way to fix this is to either set the model once the window is open,
 * or explicitly call a global layout once the window has been opened.
 * More comments below in the individual methods.
