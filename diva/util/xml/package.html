A package of utilities for the XML parsing and printing.  The central
class in this package is the XmlDocument class.  Each XmlDocument
contains a tree of XML elements, represented by XmlElement
objects. The XmlDocument knows how to print itself and perform other
useful operations. However, it does not know how to parse itself into
existence. For that, an XmlReader object must be used to populate the
XmlDocument.

<P> The XmlReader class will parse any legal XML file (containing a
reference to its DTD) and produce a parsed tree of XmlElements which
it inserts into the document. The application can then traverse the
tree to extract data or to build its own internal data structure.
Here is an example illustrating a typical use of the XmlReader to
process an XML file:

<pre>
XmlDocument document = new XmlDocument(new URL("file:/..."));
XmlReader reader = new XmlReader();
reader.setVerbose(true);
reader.parse(document);
if (reader.errorCount > 0) {
    ...do something...
    return;
}
XmlElement root = document.getRoot();
for (Iterator i = root.elements(); i.hasNext();) {
    ... process each child element... 
}
</pre>

<P>

<P>
To create an XML file, the application creates a tree of
XmlElements and inserts it into an XmlDocument. It then
calls the write() method with a Writer object. 
Here is an example illustrating a typical use:

<pre>
XmlElement root = new XmlElement();
... Add child elements to the root ...

XmlDocument document = new XmlDocument("file:/...");
document.setRoot(root);
XmlWriter writer = new XmlWriter();
writer.setVerbose(true);
writer.write(document);
</pre>
