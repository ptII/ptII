A small package for writing test suites for Java classes. This package
is designed to make it easy to write unit test suites and test suites
for object collaborations. In particular, it encourages the use of
factory classes for creating objects-under-test. Consistent use of
factories:

<ol>

<li>Enables test suites for abstract classes and interfaces to be
written.

<li>Enables tests to be run over instances of a subtree of classes,
provided that classes conform to the "inheritance is extension"
principle of OO design.

</ol>

Complete documentation and tutorial examples are on the Jester pages
in the Diva documentation tree.
