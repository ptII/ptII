/**
 * A document that contains a linear sequence of Pages.
 * This class is useful for documents which their data into logical
 * pages. Generally this class is most useful for partitioned documents
 * where all the partitions are stored together.  For partitions that are
 * stored separately, it is probably easiest to just use separate documents.
 * Note that a page can contain any kind of data, and the
 * interpretation and graphical representation of a list of page is
 * up to the concrete document class and the corresponding
 * application.  Other than containing a sequence of pages, this
 * class is used the same as AbstractDocument and provides the same abstract
 * methods.
