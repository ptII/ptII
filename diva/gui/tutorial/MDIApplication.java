 * that they are displayed in. For example, keeping documents and
 * views in sync, handling focus changes, and so on.
 *
 * The context must implement MDIContext for this to work properly.
 *
 * Note: this application only manages one view per document.
 * If you have multiple views per document, you will need to
 * implement the view-document mapping yourself.
