/**
 * A example document that contains plain boring old text
 * and saves it to ascii files.  Here you can see some sample
 * implementations of the open, save, saveAs, and close methods.
 * You should also notice that this class adds methods for accessing
 * the contained document's data in an application-useful format.
 * (In this case, there are just simple getText and setText methods.)
 * The setText properly realized that the document's data has been changed
 * and sets the Dirty flag.  This is used in the application
 * tutorial by the StoragePolicy to prevent a user from closing the document
 * without saving changes.
 * <p>
 * This class also contains a DocumentFactory for documents of this type.
 * The document factory is used by an application to create documents of
 * this type.
