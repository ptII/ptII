The Diva GUI framework. This is a simple and extensible
application framework that most applications should be
able to build on without too much trouble. There are
two kinds of class in here:

<ul>

<li> GUI components. The GUI portion makes extensive use of Swing
widgets. The set of classes of this kind ranges from simple widgets
that we needed up to full-featured application frames.

<li> Document framework classes. These classes provide a set of
classes to ease the task of constructing multi-document applications.
The document framework uses the model-view-controller
architecture to manage the state of the application.

</ul>

In both cases, we have been careful not to make policy decisions that
will impact your ability to customize and extend these classes to suit
your own needs. An example: there is no default menu layout, so you
are not restricted to using conventional (File, Edit etc) menu layouts
if you don't want to. There is, however, a good deal of support for
standard menu entries if you <i>choose</i> to use it!
