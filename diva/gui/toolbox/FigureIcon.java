 * An icon that looks like a diva figure.  This class renders the figure into

 * rather slow, so you might want to cache the returned icon somehow to
 * avoid repeating it, especially if you have a large number of icons to
 * render such as in a TreeCellRenderer.
 *
 * This class handles ImageFigure specially, to deal with image
 * loading.  Where possible, instead of painting the figure into a
 * buffered image, this class simply uses the Image of an ImageFigure.
