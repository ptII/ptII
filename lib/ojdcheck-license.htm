<h1>License for Ojdcheck</h1>
<a href="http://github.com/egonw/ojdcheck/#in_browser" target="_top">Ojdcheck</a> is used to
point out problems with Javadoc comments.    Charles Shelton (Bosch) enhanced Ojdcheck to handle enums, whereas <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/doccheck/#in_browser" target="_top">Doccheck</a> does
not handle enums.
