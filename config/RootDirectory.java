/** Given the pathname to a file in bin/ directory, return
    the pathname to installation directory by determining
    the canonical path of the executable.

    Under Matlab 5.3.0, if the matlab executable is found
    at matlabr11/bin/matlab.exe, then the top level
    directory is matlabr11, and the matlab includes
    can be found at
    matlabr11/extern/include/...

    <p>Under Matlab 6.0, if the matlab executable is found
    at matlabr12/bin/win32/matlab.exe, then the top
    level directory would be matlabr12, and the
    matlab includes would be found at
    matlabr12/extern/include/...
