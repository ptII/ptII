/**
 An analysis that maps each local and field to the set of locals and
 fields that alias that value.  Implementors of this interface determine
 the strength of the analysis.  i.e. must-aliases vs. maybe aliases,
 flow sensitive vs. flow insensitive, etc.

 FIXME: I think we need an augmented interface for
 flow-sensitive analysis?
