//// JNLPApplication

/** A wrapper class that calls eventually calls
 ptolemy.actor.gui.PtExecuteApplication for use with Java Network
 Launching Protocol (JNLP) aka Web Start.

 <p>Note that under Web Start, it is easiest if each application needs
 to have its own class and jar file containing the application class file.

 <p>In Web Start 1.0.1, it is necessary to sign the application
 if it is to have access to the local disk etc.  The way that this is
 handled is that the .jnlp file that defines the application
 is copied to the .jar file that defines the main() method for
 the application and the .jar file is signed.  Unfortunately, this means
 that two Web Start applications cannot share one jar file, so
 we create these wrapper classes that call the appropriate main class.
 <p>For more information about JNLP, see $PTII/mk/jnlp.in.
