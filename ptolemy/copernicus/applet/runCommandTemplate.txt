# We use BrowserLauncher here instead of appletviewer because under
# JDK1.3.1, the appletviewer does not seem to work well with absolute
# pathnames.  Also, most users are interested in how the page looks
# in web browser, not the appletviewer.  Also, by using the web browser
# the user can follow the link to the XXXvergil.htm page.
