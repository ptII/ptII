/** A simple application that reads in a .xml file as a command
 line argument and runs it.

 This is similar to MoMLSimpleApplication, but forces the number of
 iterations to be 100000.  This makes for good comparison with
 generated code since it reduces the relative affect of initialization
 differences between Ptolemy II and the generated code.
