# This test generates three files: FIRSingle.c, FIRSingle.h, and
# FIRSingle_i.h), and compiles,links, and executes these.  The output will
# be that produced by a single invocation of the filter on the given data
# (as specified in FIRconfig.h).  It uses FIRSingleMain.c as a wrapper. To
# change parameters of the filter, change the corresponding values in
# FIRconfig.h. 
#
# A corresponding Ptolemy II model is provided in FIRtest.xml. This model
# drives an equivalent FIR filter with an equivalent input stream. Thus,
# one can compare the output of the generated C code with the output of
# what a corresponding Ptolemy II actor would produce.
