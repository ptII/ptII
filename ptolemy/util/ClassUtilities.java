    /** Lookup a jar URL and return the resource.

     *  A resource is a file such as a class file or image file that
     *  is found in the classpath.  A jar URL is a URL that refers to
     *  a resource in a jar file.  For example,
     *  <code>file://./foo.jar!/a/b/c.class</code> is a jar URL that
     *  refers to the <code>a/b/c.class</code> resource in
     *  <code>foo.jar</code>.  If this method is called with
     *  <code>file://./foo.jar!/a/b/c.class</code> then it will return
     *  <code>a/b/c.class</code> if <code>a/b/c.class</code> can be
     *  found as a resource in the class loader that loaded this class
     *  (ptolemy.util.ClassUtilities).  If the resource cannot be found,
     *  then an IOException is thrown. If the jarURLString parameter
     *  does not contain <code>!/</code>, then return null.
     *  Note that everything before the <code>!/</code> is removed before
     *  searching the classpath.
     *
     *  <p>This method is necessary because Web Start uses jar URL, and
     *  there are some cases where if we have a jar URL, then we may
     *  need to strip off the jar:<i>url</i>!/ part so that we can
     *  search for the {entry} as a resource.
     *
     *  @param jarURLString The string containing the jar URL.
     *  @return The resource, if any.If the spec string does not
     *  contain <code>!/</code>, then return null.
     *  @exception IOException If this method cannot convert the specification
     *  to a URL.
     *  @see java.net.JarURLConnection
