//// LibraryAttribute

/**
 This class is a configurable singleton attribute that associates a
 component library with a model.  By convention, it is typically named
 "_library".  A visual editor that opens a model containing this attribute
 will offer the contents of its library as the component library for editing
 the model.  "Singleton" means that if this attribute is placed in a model,
 it will replace any previous singleton attribute that has the same name.
 "Configurable" means that the contents of the library can be set in
 a configure element in MoML, or via the configure() method.
 The library can also be set by calling setLibrary(); this will override
 any library specified by configure.
 <p>
 When creating a library to associate with this attribute, the
 library should be created in the same workspace as this attribute
 (as returned by the workspace() method).  Normally, it will have no
 container.  The text specified in the configure element (or a call
 to the configure() method) is not parsed until the getLibrary()
 method is called.  Thus, the overhead of creating the library is
 avoided if the library is not used.
