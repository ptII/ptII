/** A simple application that reads in a .xml file as a command
 line argument and runs it.

 <p>MoMLApplication sets the look and feel, which starts up Swing,
 so we can't use MoMLApplication for non-graphical simulations.

 <p>We implement the ChangeListener interface so that this
 class will get exceptions thrown by failed change requests.

 For example to use this class, try:
 <pre>
 java -classpath $PTII ptolemy.actor.gui.MoMLSimpleApplication ../../../ptolemy/domains/sdf/demo/OrthogonalCom/OrthogonalCom.xml
 </pre>
