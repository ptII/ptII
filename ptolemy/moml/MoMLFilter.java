     *  means XML attribute, not Ptolemy II attribute. Also,

     *  element.  So, for example, if you have:
     *  <pre>
     *    &lt;entity name="foo" class="..."&gt;
     *       &lt;property name="x" value="10"/&gt;

     *  being the instance "foo". On the first call, the
     *  <i>attributeName</i> will be "name" and the
     *  <i>attributeValue</i> will be "x".  On the second call,
     *  <i>attributeName</i> will be "value" and the
     *  <i>attributeValue</i> will be "10".
     *  To make no change to the attribute value, an implementer
     *  should simply return the same attributeValue.
     *  To cause the MoMLParser to ignore the current element
     *  altogether, an implementer should return null. For
     *  example, to skip a graphical class, create a filter that
     *  looks for <i>attributeName</i> equal to "class" and
     *  <i>attributeValue</i> equal to the class name to skip.
     *  Note that if the <i>attributeValue</i> argument is null,
     *  then returning null is interpreted as no change, rather than
     *  as an indication to skip the element.
     *  To change the value of the attribute, simply return a
     *  a new value for the attribute.
     *  <p>
     *  If modifies the attribute value, then it should call
     *  the static method MoMLParser.setModified(true), which indicates
     *  that the model was modified so that the user can optionally
     *  save the modified model.
