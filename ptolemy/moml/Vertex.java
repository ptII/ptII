 This attribute represents a waypoint in a relation. It extends
 Location, meaning that can be associated with a physical location
 in a visual rendition.  It can optionally be associated with another
 instance of Vertex to indicate that there is a path from this
 one to the other one. Cyclic paths are not permitted, although
 currently that is not enforced by this class.
