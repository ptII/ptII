# This .bat file should run the shutdown command from the directory
# c:\Windows\System32 with the arguments -r, -t0, and -f which does a
# reboot in 0 seconds with a force shutdown of any running commands.
# We can't include the actual command in the release because some over
# eager virus checkers mark it as a virus.
