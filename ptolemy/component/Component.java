/**
 This interface defines the basic methods for initializing and
 executing components. The intended usage is that preinitialize()
 is invoked exactly once in an execution of a model, before any
 static analysis such as scheduling or type resolution is done.
 The initialize() method may be invoked more than once to
 initialize() a component, and it is invoked after static analysis.
 The run() method may be invoked multiple times after initialize().
 The wrapup() method is invoked exactly once at the end of an
 execution of a model. It is important that an implementor ensure
 that wrapup() is called even if an exception occurs.
