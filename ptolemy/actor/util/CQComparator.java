/**
 This interface extends the java.util.Comparator interface, which
 defines the compare() method. The extension defines additional methods
 that specifically support the CalendarQueue class.  That class needs
 to associate an entry in the queue with a virtual bin number, and
 needs to be able to periodically recompute the width of its bins.
 Thus, merely being able to compare entries is not sufficient.

    /** Given an entry, return a virtual bin number for the entry.
     *  The virtual bin number is a quantized version of whatever
     *  key is being used to compare entries.
     *  The calculation performed should be something like:
     *  <p>
     *  <i>(entry - zeroReference) / binWidth</i>,
     *  </p>
     *  with the result cast to long.
     *  <p>
     *  Because of the way this is used by CalendarQueue, it is OK
     *  to return the low order 64 bits of the result if the result
     *  does not fit in 64 bits. The result will be masked anyway
     *  to get fewer low order bits that represent the bin number.
     *  As a net result, time stamps that differ by exactly 2^64 times
     *  the time resolution will appear in the event queue to be occurring
     *  at the same time.
     *  <p>
     *  Classes that implement this interface will in general need
     *  to perform a downcast on the arguments (of type Object) to the
     *  appropriate user defined classes. If the arguments are not of
     *  appropriate type, the implementation should throw a
     *  ClassCastException.
     *
     *  @param entry An object that can be inserted in a calendar queue.
     *  @return The index of the bin.
