/**
 This class provides a causality interface
 where no output port depends on any input port.
 That is, the dependency of any output port on any
 input port is the oPlusIdentity() of the specified
 default dependency.
 <p>
 The {@link #equivalentPorts(IOPort)} normally returns list
 containing only the specified port. If, however, the actor
 has any instance of PortParameter in its input port list, then
 it returns a list of all input ports. The reason for this is
 that any output, present or future, may depend on the values at
 such port parameters. In particular, it is necessary for inputs
 on these port parameters to be present when any other input is
 processed because it affects the parameters of the actor.
 It is more efficient to use this
 class than to use the base class and call removeDependency()
 to remove all the dependencies.
