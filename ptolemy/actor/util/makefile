# This directory contains classes used for dataflow and pn channels that
# should _not_ go into the kernel so that we can keep the kernel free
# of the notion of dataflow.  These classes are concurrent functional
# classes:
#  FIFOQueue
#  Star
#  Galaxy
#  Universe
# Note that none of these classes would be relevant to FSMs, for example.
