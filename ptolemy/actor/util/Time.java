/**
 * An object of the Time class represents time in a model. An instance of Time
 * has a value that is immutable. It has no limit on the magnitude, and
 * it does not lose resolution as the magnitude increases. There are
 * two time constants: NEGATIVE_INFINITY and POSITIVE_INFINITY.
 * <p>
 * The time value is quantized to the time resolution specified by the
 * <i>timeResolution</i> parameter of the associated director. The reason for
 * this is that without quantization, it is extremely difficult to compare two
 * time values with digit-to-digit accuracy because of the unpredictable
 * numerical errors introduced during computation. In practice, two time values
 * can only be distinguished if their difference can be detected by some
 * measuring instrument, which always has a smallest unit for measurement. This
 * smallest unit measurement gives the physical meaning of the time resolution
 * used for quantization.
 * <p>
 * This implementation of Time does not lose resolution as the magnitude of
 * the time increases (unlike floating point numbers). This is because
 * Time is represented internally as a multiple of the resolution, and
 * the multiple is not constrained to any limited magnitude.
 * <p>
 * The time value can be retrieved in three ways, the {@link #toString()}method
 * and the {@link #getDoubleValue()}method and the {@link #getLongValue()}
 * method. The first method returns a string representation while the second
 * method returns a double value. There are some limitations on both methods.
 * For the toString() method, we cannot directly do numerical operations on
 * strings. For the getDoubleValue() method, we can not guarantee that the
 * returned double value preserves the time resolution because of the limited
 * digits for double representation. We recommend to operate on time objects
 * directly instead of the time values of time objects. getLongValue() returns
 * an integer multiple of the director resolution.
 * <p>
 * Two operations, add and subtract, can be performed on a time object, where
 * the argument can be a double or a time object. If the argument is not a time
 * object, the argument is quantized before the operations are performed. These
 * operations return a new time object with a quantized result.
 * <p>
 * The time value of a time object can be infinite. The add and subtract
 * operations on infinite time values follow rules similar to the IEEE Standard
 * 754 for Floating Point Numbers. In particular, adding two positive or negative
 * infinities yield a positive or negative infinity; adding a positive infinity to
 * a negative infinity, however, triggers an ArithmeticException; the negation
 * of a positive or negative infinity is a negative or positive infinity,
 * respectively.
 * <p>
 * This class implements the Comparable interface, where two time objects can be
 * compared in the following way. If any of the two time objects contains an
 * infinite time value, the rules are: a negative infinity is equal to a
 * negative infinity and less than anything else; a positive infinity is equal
 * to a positive infinity and bigger than anything else. If none of the time
 * objects has an infinite time value, the time values of two time objects are
 * compared. If the time values are the same, the two time objects are treated
 * equal, or they represent the same model time. Otherwise, the time object
 * containing a bigger time value is regarded to happen after the time object
 * with a smaller time value.
 * <p>
 * All time objects share the same time resolution, which is provided by the
 * top-level director. In some domains, such as CT and DE, users can change the
 * time resolution by configuring the <i>timeResolution </i> parameter. The
 * default value for this parameter "1E-10", which has value 10 <sup>-10 </sup>.
 * To preserve the consistency of time values, timeResolution cannot be changed
 * when a model is running (attempting to do so will trigger an exception).
