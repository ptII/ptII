/**
 Interface for directors that have a <i>period</i> parameter.
 These directors are, by default, untimed, but become timed when
 the <i>period</i> parameter is given a value other than 0.0.
 The <i>period</i> parameter, if non-zero, specifies the
 amount of model time that elapses per iteration.
 In this case, the director should fire only at times
 that are multiples of the <i>period</i>. If the director is
 at the top level, then it is responsible for incrementing time
 between iterations. Otherwise, it is responsible for invoking
 fireAt() on the enclosing executive director to request
 subsequent firings, and refusing to fire (by returning false
 from prefire()) at times that are not multiples of the <i>period</i>.
