//// SuperdenseDependency

/**
 This dependency represents causal relationships that have a real value
 and a superdense time index. If the real value is infinite, this
 represents the lack of a causal relationship.
 A finite positive real value represents a causal dependency with (typically)
 a time delay. A zero value represents no time delay, but whether there is
 an immediate causal relationship depends on the index. If the index is 0,
 then there is an immediate causal relationship. Otherwise, there is not.
