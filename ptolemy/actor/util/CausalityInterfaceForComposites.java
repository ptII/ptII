     *  The depth of an input port is maximum of the
     *  "source depths" of all the input ports in the
     *  same equivalence class with the specified port.
     *  An equivalence class is defined as follows.
     *  If ports X and Y each have a dependency not equal to the
     *  default dependency's oPlusIdentity(), then they
     *  are in an equivalence class. That is,
     *  there is a causal dependency. They are also in
     *  the same equivalence class if there is a port Z
     *  in an equivalence class with X and in an equivalence
     *  class with Y. Otherwise, they are not in the same
     *  equivalence class. If there are no
     *  output ports, then all the input ports
     *  are in a single equivalence class.
     *  <p>
     *  The "source depth" of an input port is one plus the maximum
     *  depth of all output ports that directly source data
     *  to it, or zero if there are no such ports.
     *  This delays the firing of this actor until
     *  all source actors have fired. As a side
     *  effect, this method also sets the depth of all the
     *  input ports in the same equivalence class, as well
     *  as all upstream ports up to a break with non-causal
     *  relationship. It also detects and reports dependency
     *  cycles.  The entry point
