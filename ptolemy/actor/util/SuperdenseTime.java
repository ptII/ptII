//// SuperdenseTime

/**
 This class defines the structure of superdense time used in domains having
 time involved in computation. A superdense time object, s, consists of a time
 stamp and an index, denoted as s = (t, n).
 <p>
 Two superdense time objects can be compared to see which one happens first.
 The order is defined by the relationship between their time stamps and
 indexes. In particular, given s_1 = (t_1, n_1) and s_2 = (t_2, n_2), s_1
 happens earlier than s_2 (denoted as s_1 <= s_2), if t_1 < t_2 or (t_1 == t_2
 and n_1 <= n_2). The equality relation holds only if both t_1 == t_2 and
 n_1 == n_2 hold.
