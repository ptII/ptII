//// DependencyDeclaration

/**
 An instance of DependencyDeclaration is an attribute that declares
 variable dependence information of a parameter.  This attribute is
 usually created in a parameter, when necessary, during the
 preinitialize method of an actor.  This class is used primarily by the
 ConstVariableModelAnalysis class to determine a change context for
 parameters whose value dependence is not declared through an
 expression reference, but maintained by the actor's Java code instead.

 <p> This attribute is not persistent by default, so it will not be exported
 into a MoML representation of the model.
