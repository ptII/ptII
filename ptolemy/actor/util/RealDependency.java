//// RealDependency

/**
 This dependency represents causal relationships that have a real value
 or are infinite. Infinity represents the lack of a causal relationship.
 A finite positive real value represents a causal dependency with (typically)
 a time delay. A zero value represents an immediate causal relationship.
