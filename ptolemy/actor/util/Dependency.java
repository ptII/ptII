/**
 This interface provides a dependency for causality interfaces as described
 in the paper "Causality Interfaces for Actor Networks" by Ye Zhou and
 Edward A. Lee, ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS),
 April 2008, as available as <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-148.pdf">
 Technical Report No. UCB/EECS-2006-148</a>,
 November 16, 2006.
 <p>
 A dependency represents a causality relationship between two ports.
 Implementations of this interface are required to satisfy certain
 algebraic properties, but as long as these are satisfied, there is
 considerable freedom.
