/**
 A first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue receiver with variable capacity and
 optional history. Tokens are put into the receiver with the put() method,
 and removed from the receiver with the get() method. The token removed is
 the oldest one in the receiver. By default, the capacity is unbounded, but
 it can be set to any nonnegative size. If the history capacity is greater
 than zero (or infinite, indicated by a capacity of INFINITE_CAPACITY),
 then tokens removed from the receiver are stored in a history queue rather
 than simply removed. By default, the history capacity is zero.
