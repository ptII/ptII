/**
 * A composite actor whose ports have types, but the actors inside are
 * not required to be typed. This actor does not impose any type
 * constraints between its ports, so any output ports of this actor
 * have to have explicitly declared types. There is no mechanism for
 * inferring the types of the output ports. Note that the ports of
 * this actor cannot be linked on the inside to untyped relations, and
 * by default, any relation created on the inside will be untyped.
 *
 * <p> The intended use of this actor is for scenarios where the
 * inside structure is not part of the Ptolemy type system. For
 * example, the inside structure may define a component that will be
 * translated into executable code by a code generator. A subclass of
 * this actor would typically include the code generator an a
 * mechanism for executing the generating code.
