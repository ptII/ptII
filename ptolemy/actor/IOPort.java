//// IOPort

/**
 This class supports exchanging data between entities via message passing.
 It can serve as an input port, an output port, or both. If it is an
 input port, then it contains some number of receivers, which are
 responsible for receiving data from remote entities. If it is an
 output port, then it can send data to remote receivers.

 <p>
 Its receivers are created by a director.  It must therefore be
 contained by an actor that has a director.  If it is not, then
 any attempt to read data or list the receivers will trigger
 an exception.

 <p>
 If this port is at the boundary of an composite actor, then it
 can have both inside and outside links, with corresponding inside
 and outside receivers if it opaque. The inside links are to
 relations inside the opaque composite actor, whereas the outside
 links are to relations outside. If it is not specified, then a link
 is an outside link.

 <p>
 The port has a <i>width</i>, which by default is constrained to
 be either zero or one.
 The width is the sum of the widths of the linked relations.
 A port with a width greater than one behaves as a bus interface,
 so if the width is <i>w</i>, then the port can simultaneously
 handle <i>w</i> distinct input or output channels of data.

 <p>
 In general, an input port might have more than one receiver for
 each channel.  This occurs particularly for transparent input ports,
 which treat the receivers of the ports linked on the inside as its own.
 This might also occur for opaque ports in some derived classes.
 Each receiver in the group is sent the same data. Thus, an input port in
 general will have <i>w</i> distinct groups of receivers, and can receive
 <i>w</i> distinct channels.

 <p>
 By default, the maximum width of the port is one, so only one
 channel is handled. A port that allows a width greater than one
 is called a <i>multiport</i>. Calling setMultiport() with a
 <i>true</i> argument converts the port to a multiport.

 <p>
 The width of the port is not set directly. It is the sum of the
 widths of the relations that the port is linked to on the outside.
 The sum of the widths of the relations linked on the inside can be
 more or less than the width.  If it is more, then the excess inside
 relations will be treated as if they are unconnected.  If it is
 less, then the excess outside relations will be treated as if they
 are unconnected.

 <p>
 An IOPort can only link to instances of IORelation. Derived classes
 may further constrain links to a subclass of IORelation.  To do
 this, they should override the protected methods _checkLink() and
 _checkLiberalLink() to throw an exception if their arguments are
 not of the appropriate type.  Similarly, an IOPort can only be
 contained by a class derived from ComponentEntity and implementing
 the Actor interface.  Subclasses may further constrain the
 containers by overriding the protected method _checkContainer().
