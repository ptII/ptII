# Note: To compile the CorbaActor.idl, use:
# prompt> idltojava -p ptolemy.actor.corba -j ../../.. CorbaActor.idl
#
# idltojava can be downloaded from:
#
# http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/jdk12/idltojava.html
#
# idltojava takes the CorbaActor.idl and generate all the files in the
# ptolemy/actor/corba/util directory.
#
# Currently, all generated java files in the util directory are checked in,
# and the command need to be run only if the CorbaActor.idl is changed.
# Then the newly generated java files need to be checked in again.
# This may not be the right way to do it...
