//// TypedIORelation

/**
 This class overrides some of the methods in IORelation to ensure that
 TypedIOPorts are only connected to TypedIOPorts. I.e., Instances of
 TypedIORelation can only be linked to instances of TypedIOPort.
 Derived classes may further constrain this to subclasses of TypedIOPort.
 Such derived classes should override the protected method _checkPort()
 to throw an exception.
 <p>
 To link a TypedIOPort to a TypedIORelation, use the link() or
 liberalLink() method in the TypedIOPort class.  To remove a link,
 use the unlink() method.
 <p>
 The container for instances of this class can only be instances of
 TypedCompositeActor.  Derived classes may wish to further constrain the
 container to subclasses of TypedComponentEntity.  To do this, they should
 override the _checkContainer() method.
