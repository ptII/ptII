//// IORelation


/**
 This class mediates connections between ports that can send data to
 one another via message passing. One purpose of this relation is to
 ensure that IOPorts are only connected to IOPorts. A second purpose
 is to support the notion of a <i>width</i> to represent something
 like a bus. By default an IORelation is a bus for which the width will be
 inferred, which means that its width is -1. Calling setWidth() with
 an argument larger than one makes the relation a bus of fixed width.
 Calling setWidth() with an argument equal to the value of
 WIDTH_TO_INFER makes the relation
 a bus with indeterminate width, in which case the width will be
 inferred (if possible) from the context.  In particular,
 if this relation is linked on the inside to a port with some
 width, then the width of this relation will be inferred to
 be the enough so that the widths of all inside linked relations
 adds up to the outside width of the port.
 The actual width of an IORelation
 can never be less than one. If this IORelation is linked to another
 instance of IORelation, then the width of the two IORelations is
 constrained to be the same.
 <p>
 Instances of IORelation can only be linked to instances of IOPort
 or instances of IORelation.
 Derived classes may further constrain this to subclasses of IOPort
 of IORelation.
 Such derived classes should override the protected methods _checkPort()
 and _checkRelation() to throw an exception.
 <p>
 To link a IOPort to an IORelation, use the link() or
 liberalLink() method in the IOPort class.  To remove a link,
 use the unlink() method. To link (unlink) an IORelation to an IORelation,
 use the link() (unlink()) method of IORelation.
 <p>
 The container for instances of this class can only be instances of
 CompositeActor.  Derived classes may wish to further constrain the
 container to subclasses of ComponentEntity.  To do this, they should
 override the _checkContainer() method.
