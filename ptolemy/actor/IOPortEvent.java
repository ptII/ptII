/**
 An event that is published by an IOPort when a token is sent or received.

 <p>In Kepler the provenance recorder and the activity monitor use
 these events to save intermediate results / show status of the
 workflow.  In the future these events could be used for "smart"
 reruns or a fault tolerance mechanism.
