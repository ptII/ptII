 A director that does nothing, for use in models that have no useful
 execution.

 <p>This director is added to models for code generation purposes when
 the model has no useful execution but the code generator runs
 CompositeActor.preinitialize().</p> 
 
 <p>If this director is used in a model, then adding a <code>_hide</code>
 attribute to the director will make the director invisible to the user.</p>
