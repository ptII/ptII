/**
 Interface for objects that can hold tokens. An implementation of this
 interface has two key methods: put() and get(). The put() method
 deposits a token into the receiver. The get() method retrieves
 a token that has been put. The order of
 the retrieved tokens depends on specific implementations, and does not
 necessarily match the order in which tokens have been put.
 <p>
 All implementations of this interface must follow these rules, regardless
 of the number of threads that are accessing the receiver:
 <ul>
 <li> If hasToken() returns true, then the next call to get() must not
 result in a NoTokenException being thrown.
 <li> If hasRoom() returns true, then the next call to put() must not
 result in a NoRoomException being thrown.
 </ul>
 In general, this means that multithreaded domains must provide
 synchronization for receivers. Note that both NoTokenException
 and NoRoomException are runtime exceptions, so they need not be
 declared explicitly.
 <p>
 Objects that implement this interface can only be contained
 by an instance of IOPort.
