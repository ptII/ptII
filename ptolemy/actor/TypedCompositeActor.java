//// TypedCompositeActor

/**
 <p>A TypedCompositeActor is an aggregation of typed actors.</p>
 <p>
 When exporting MoML, instances of this class identify their class name
 as TypedCompositeActor. If a derived class does not change this, then it
 too will be identified as a TypedCompositeActor. To change this in a
 derived class, put the following line in the constructor
 <pre>
 getMoMLInfo().className = "<i>full class name</i>";
 </pre>
 If you do this, you will probably also want to override _exportMoMLContents()
 to not generate a description of the contents of the composite, since
 they will be already defined in the Java class.
 </p>
 <p>
 The ports of a TypedCompositeActor are constrained to be TypedIOPorts,
 the relations to be TypedIORelations, and the actors to be instances of
 ComponentEntity that implement the TypedActor interface.  Derived classes
 may impose further constraints by overriding newPort(), _addPort(),
 newRelation(), _addRelation(), and _addEntity(). Also, derived classes may
 constrain the container by overriding _checkContainer().
