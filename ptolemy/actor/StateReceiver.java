/**
 This is a marker interface for receivers that have <i>state</i> semantics.
 That is, whenever a get method is called on this receiver, the
 current token is always available and returned. Further more, if
 no put method is called between get methods, the returned tokens are
 always the same. Usually, the receivers that implement this interface
 have capacity of 1.
 <p>
 Receivers that do not implement this marker interface have <i>event</i>
 semantics, which means that when a get method is called on the receiver,
 the current token is returned and it is also removed from the receiver.
