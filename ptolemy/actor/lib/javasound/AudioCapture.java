//// AudioCapture

/**
 This actor sequentially outputs audio samples that are captured
 from the audio input port of the computer. The audio input port
 typically corresponds to either the microphone input, line-in,
 or cd audio from the cdrom or dvd drive. It is not possible to
 select the desired input port under Java. This must be done from
 the operating system. This actor should be fired often enough to
 prevent overflow of the internal audio capture buffer.
 Overflow should be avoided, since it will result in loss of
 data. Each captured audio sample is converted to a double that
 may range from -1.0 to 1.0. Thus, the output type of this actor
 is DoubleToken.
 <p>
 The following parameters should be set accordingly. In all cases,
 an exception is thrown if an illegal parameter value is used.
 Note that these parameters may be changed while audio playback
 is active. If this actor is used in conjunction with an
 AudioPlayer actor, changing a parameter will cause the corresponding
 parameter value of the AudioPlayer to automatically be set to the
 same value. This behavior is required because the AudioCapture and
 AudioPlayer actors both share access to the audio hardware, which
 is associated with a single sample rate, bit resolution, and
 number of channels.
 <ul>
 <li><i>sampleRate</i> should be set to the desired sample rate, in Hz.
 The default value is 8000. Allowable values are 8000, 11025,
 22050, 44100, and 48000 Hz. Note that Java does not support
 96000 Hz operation, even if the audio hardware supports it.
 <li><i>bitsPerSample</i> should be set to the desired bit
 resolution. The default value is 16. Allowable values are 8 and 16.
 Note that Java does not support 20 or 24 bit audio, even if the
 audio hardware supports it.
 <li><i>channels</i> should be set to desired number of audio
 channels. The default value is 1 (for mono audio). Allowable
 values are 1 and 2 (for stereo). Note that more than two
 channels of audio is not currently supported in Java, even if
 the audio hardware supports it.
 </ul>
 <p>
 It should be noted that at most one AudioCapture and one AudioPlayer
 actor may be used simultaneously. Otherwise, an exception will
 occur. This restriction may be lifted in a future version of
 this actor.
 <p>
 There are security issues involved with accessing files and audio
 resources in applets. Applets are not
 allowed to capture audio from the audio input port (e.g., the
 microphone) by default since this could present a security risk.
 Therefore, the actor will not run in an applet by default. The
 .java.policy file may be modified to grant applets more
 privileges.
 <p>
 Note: Requires Java 2 v1.3.0 or later.
