/**
 Perform real-time pitch shifting of audio signals. This only works
 for audio signals that have either a unique pitch or no pitch at
 any given time (pitched or unpitched, voiced or unvoiced). Examples
 inlude human vocal sounds and sounds from musical instruments capable
 of playing only one note at a times (e.g., horns, flute). The pitch
 shifting algorithm is based on the algorithm proposed by Keith Lent
 in his paper: "An efficient Method for Pitch Shifting Digitally
 Sampled Sounds", published in the Computer Music Journal, Vol 13,
 No. 4, Winter 1989. The algorithm is presented with more mathematical
 rigore in the paper by Robert Bristow-Johnson:
 "A Detailed Analysis of a Time-Domain Formant-Corrected Pitch-
 Shifting Algorithm", in J. Audio Eng. Soc., Vol 43, No. 5, May 1995.
 <p>
 The pitch shifting algorithm uses a pitch-synchronous overlap-add (PSOLA)
 based algorithm, and therefore requires the pitch of the input signal.
 The pitch detector used in Keith Lent's algorithm consists of a
 bandpass filter followed by a simple negative-slop zero-crossing detector.
 I found such a simple pitch detector to be completely unusable for
 vocal and musical instrument sounds. I therefore decided to implement
 a more robust pitch detector. I am currently using a pitch detector
 that uses cepstrum analysis. The (real) cepstrum is computed, and
 then peak finding is performed on the high-time region of the cepstrum.
 This cepstral technique works well for vocal sounds but does not
 currently perform well for pitches above about 600 Hz.
 <p>
 Note: This application requires JDK 1.3. and at least a
 Pentium II 400 MHz class processor (for 22050 Hz sample rate).
