Quantity Manager actors.

<p>The Metropolis project introduced
the notion of "quantity manager," a component of a model that functions as a gateway
to another model. For example, a purely functional model that describes only idealized
behavioral properties of a flight control system could be endowed with a quantity manager
that binds that functional model to a model of a distributed hardware architecture using
a particular network fabric. By binding these two models, designers can evaluate
how properties of the hardware implementation affect the functional behavior of the system.
For example, how does a time-triggered bus protocol affect timing in a distributed
control system, and how do the timing effects change the dynamics of the system?
Similarly, a functional model could be endowed with a quantity manager that
measures power usage and identifies potential overloads that may result from
unexpectedly synchronized interactions across a distributed system.
