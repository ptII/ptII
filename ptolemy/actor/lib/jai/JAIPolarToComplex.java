 Output a complex image with alternating real and imaginary bands.  This
 actor takes two inputs, an image representing the magnitude of the
 bands, and an image representing the phase of the bands.  The two
 inputs must have the same number of bands.

 <p> The output of this actor may not be suitable for displaying or saving
 because of the increase in the number of bands, as well as the high
 resolution of the data (doubles).
