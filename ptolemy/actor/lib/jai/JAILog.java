/**
 Output the logarithm of an image.  This actor can be used to reduce the
 dynamic range of an image.  For instance, the magnitude of a dft can
 have a large dynamic range not suitable for display.  Taking the
 logarithm of this image and then casting it using {@link JAIDataConvert} could
 produce a better image for displaying.

 <p> For integral image data types, the result is rounded and clamped.  For
 all integral image data types, the log of 0 is 0.  For signed image
 data types (shorts and ints), the log of a negative pixel is -1.  For
 floats and doubles, the log of 0 is set to -Infinity, and the log of a
 negative pixel is NaN.

 <p> The output of this actor may not be suitable for display because of the
 high resolution of the data.  To display or save the output of this
 image, use the {@link JAIDataConvert} actor to cast the data to an appropriate
 type (for instance, byte).
