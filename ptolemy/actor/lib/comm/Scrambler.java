/**
 Scramble the input bit sequence using a feedback shift register.
 The initial state of the shift register is given by the <i>initialState</i>
 parameter, which should be a non-negative integer.
 The taps of the feedback shift register are given by the <i>polynomial</i>
 parameter, which should be a positive integer.
 The n-th bit of this integer indicates whether the n-th tap of the delay
 line is fed back.
 The low-order bit is called the 0-th bit, and should always be set.
 The next low-order bit indicates whether the output of the first delay
 should be fed back, etc.
 The input port receives boolean tokens. "TRUE" is treated as 1 and "FALSE"
 is treated as 0. All the bits that are fed back are exclusive-ored together
 (i.e., their parity is computed), and the result is exclusive-ored with the
 input bit. The result is produced at the output and shifted into the delay line.
 <p>
 With a proper choice of polynomial, the resulting output appears highly
 random even if the input is highly non-random.
 If the polynomial is a <i>primitive polynomial</i>, then the feedback
 shift register is a so-called <i>maximal length feedback shift register</i>.
 This means that with a constant input (or no input, which is equivalent
 to a constant <i>false</i> input) the output will be a sequence with
 period 2<sup><i>N</i></sup>-1, where <i>N</i> is the order of the
 polynomial (the length of the shift register).
 This is the longest possible sequence.
 Moreover, within this period, the sequence will appear to be white,
 in that a computed autocorrelation will be very nearly an impulse.
 Thus, the scrambler with a constant input can be very effectively used
 to generate a pseudo-random bit sequence.
 <p>
 The maximal-length feedback shift register with constant input will
 pass through 2<sup><i>N</i></sup>-1 states before returning to a state
 it has been in before.  This is one short of the 2<sup><i>N</i></sup>
 states that a register with <i>N</i> bits can take on.  This one missing
 state, in fact, is a <i>lock-up</i> state, in that if the input is
 an appropriate constant, the scrambler will cease to produce random-looking
 output, and will output a constant. For example, if the input is all zeros,
 and the initial state of the scrambler is zero, then the outputs will be all
 zero, hardly random. This is easily avoided by initializing the scrambler
 to some non-zero state. The default value for the <i>shiftReg</i> is set to 1.
 <p>
 The <i>polynomial</i> must be carefully chosen. It must represent a
 <i>primitive polynomial</i>, which is one that cannot be factored into two
 (nontrivial) polynomials with binary coefficients.  See Lee and Messerschmitt
 (Kluwer, 1994) for more details.  For convenience, we give here
 a set of primitive polynomials
 (expressed as octal numbers so that they are easily translated into taps
 on shift register).  All of these will result in maximal-length pseudo-random
 sequences if the input is constant and lock-up is avoided:

 </pre>
 <p>
 The leading zero in the polynomial indicates an octal number.
 Note also that reversing the order of the bits in any of these numbers
 will also result in a primitive polynomial.
 Thus, the default value for the polynomial parameter
 is 0440001 in octal, or "100 100 000 000 000 001" in binary.
 Reversing these bits we get "100 000 000 000 001 001" in binary, or
 0400011 in octal.
 This latter number is the one listed above as the primitive polynomial
 of order 17.
 The order is simply the index of the highest-order non-zero in the polynomial,
 where the low-order bit has index zero.
 <p>
 Since the polynomial and the feedback shift register are both implemented
 using type "int", the order of the polynomial is limited by the size of
 the "int" data type.
 For simplicity and portability, the polynomial is not allowed to be
 interpreted as a negative integer, so the sign bit cannot be used.
 Thus, if "int" is a 32-bit word, then the highest order polynomial allowed
 is 30 (recall that indexing for the order starts at zero, and we cannot
 use the sign bit).
 Java has 32-bit integers, so we give the primitive
 polynomials above only up to order 30.
