//// TrellisDecoder

/**
 The TrellisDecoder is a generalization of the ViterbiDecoder. It
 can handle trellis coding, which has non-antipodal constellation.
 For a <i>k</i>/<i>n</i> convolutional code, the constellation
 should map each codeword into a complex number. Hence the length
 of the constellation should be a complex array of length
 2<i><sup>n</sup></i>. For example, a 1/2 rate convolutional code
 should use 4PSK. a <i>k</i>/3 convolutional code should use 8PSK.
 <p>
 The input port of the TrellisDecoder is complex. On each firing,
 the TrellisDecoder reads one input. The Euclidean distance is defined
 as the distance between the noisy input and the point in the
 constellation mapped from the codeword. Like in ViterbiDecoder,
 this actor produces <i>k</i> outputs on each firing.
 <p>
 See ConvolutionalCoder and ViterbiDecoder for details about
 the meaning of these parameters.
