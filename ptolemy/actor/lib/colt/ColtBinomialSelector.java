//// Binomial Selector

/**

 Assign trials from several populations using a conditional Binomial
 selection process.  For example, if a vector of <code>P</code>
 populations are presented (as <code>P</code> input channels) and
 <code>N</code> trials is specified, then this algorithm will
 distribute the <code>N</code> trials based on the proportions
 represented in the <code>P</code> populations.  This is done by
 performing a progressively conditional Binomial selection in which
 <code>n</code> and <code>p</code> change after each trial assignment
 step.  The Binomial trials (<code>n</code>) is decremented after each
 assignment step to represent the remaining trials, and the new
 Binomial probability (<code>p</code>) is calculated based on the
 populations that remain eligible for selection.

 <p> A new set of trial assignments is produced for each iteration and
 will not change until the next iteration.  The values that are
 generated are independent and the expected values of the assignments
 will have expected values that are representative of the population
 proportions.
