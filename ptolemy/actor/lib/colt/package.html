Classes that use the Colt package to generate random numbers.
<p>
 <br>Colt is an
"Open Source Libraries for High Performance
Scientific and Technical Computing in Java"

<br>These classes use the Colt library from
<a href="http://hoschek.home.cern.ch/hoschek/colt/" target="_top"><CODE>http://hoschek.home.cern.ch/hoschek/colt/</CODE></a>

<p><code>$PTII/lib/ptcolt.jar</code> is a subset of the Colt classes necessary
to compile these classes.  Usually, you need only add 
<code>$PTII/lib/ptcolt.jar</code> to your classpath by running
<pre>
cd $PTII
rm config.*; ./configure
</pre>

<p>Note that if configure finds colt.jar then configure will put
colt.jar in front of ptcolt.jar in the classpath.  

<code>$PTII/lib/ptcolt.jar</code> includes an updated 
<a href="http://www.honeylocust.com/RngPack/">RngPack1.1a</a>, which
includes fixes to "fixes a number of serious bugs in RngPack 1.0 including an incorrect coefficient in the Ranecu implementation and fixes an off-by-one error in the choice() method."
Colt-1.0.3 shipped with RngPack1.0, we recommend using ptcolt.jar,
which includes RngPack1.1a.


<p>If you want to work with the full version of Colt, download Colt
and unjar so that $PTII/vendors/misc/colt/colt.jar is created:

<pre>
cd $PTII/vendors/misc
mkdir colt
jar -xf /tmp/colt1.0.3.zip
</pre>
The rerun configure:
<pre>
cd $PTII
rm config.*; ./configure
</pre>
and run make in this directory
<pre>
cd $PTII/ptolemy/actor/lib/colt
make
</pre>
