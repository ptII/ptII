/**
 Base class for sequence sources.  A sequence source is
 a source where the output value is logically a sequence, independent
 of time, but dependent on the iteration number.  For some time-based
 domains, such as CT, actors of this type probably do not make sense
 because the number of iterations that the actor experiences per unit
 time is not easily determined or controlled.  This actor has a parameter,
 <i>firingCountLimit</i>, that optionally limits the number of iterations
 for which the actor is fired.  If this number is <i>n</i> > 0, then
 the <i>n</i>-th invocation of postfire() returns false, which indicates
 to the scheduler that it should stop invocations of this actor.
 The default value of <i>firingCountLimit</i>
 is NONE, which results in postfire always returning
 true.  Derived classes must call super.postfire() for this mechanism to
 work.
