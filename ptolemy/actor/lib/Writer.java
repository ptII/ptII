 This actor reads tokens from any number of input channels and writes
 their string values to the specified writer.  A newline character
 is written between firings.  If the width of the input port is greater
 than one, then values read from the distinct channels are separated
 by tab characters. If no writer is specified using setWriter(), then
 this actor writes to the standard output.
