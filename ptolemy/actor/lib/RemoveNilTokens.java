/**
 Read in tokens and silently discard any tokens that are marked as
 nil.  Non-nill tokens are transferred to the output.

 <p>In the real world, data sources sometimes pass null values
 when data sources are sparsely populated.  The null values are sometimes
 called missing values.  The Ptolemy II expression language represents
 the missing or null tokens with the string "nil".

 <p>This actor should not be used in the SDF domain because
 the number of tokens sent to the output depends on the input.
