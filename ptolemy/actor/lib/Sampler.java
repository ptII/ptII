/**
 This actor generates discrete events by sampling the input signal whenever
 the <i>trigger</i> input is present. 
 This sampler will send to the output whatever input occurs
 at a sample time; if the input is absent, the output will be
 absent.
 <p>
 This actor has multiport inputs and outputs. Signals in
 each input channel are sampled and produced to corresponding output
 channel. When there are multiple inputs, the first non-absent input
 from each channel is read, and the output is produced at the first
 microstep after the last of the inputs became non-absent.
