<h1>ArchitectureModel</h1>
This Ptolemy II model was created by the created by the TSSTtoPTII ModelCreator to  enable use of Ptolemy II as a simulation environment
for the Trade Space Specification Tool underdevelopment at the NASA Jet Propulsion Labratory.
The model results will help determine performance, mass, costs, risk, and other trends based on architectures selected for the spacecraft.

Since there can be multiple variants as well as multiple architecture options specified by the Trade Space Specification Tool, 
we used a generic fuzzy logic actor that can be customized for each architecture option.

Fuzzy Logic is multi-valued logic derived from Fuzzy Set Theory by Lotfi Zadeh. In fuzzy logic, reasoning is approximate instead of
precise and takes on values between 0 and 1.

Each fuzzy logic actor needs an xml file the specifies how is should interpret values. The xml file is expected to be specified
in XML/FCL Fuzzy Control Language XML.

The model uses a generic Ptolemy II directorto fire the fuzzy logic actors from left to right.

ArchitectureModel is available as:
<ul>
<script src="../../../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "ArchitectureModel.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="ArchitectureModelVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
