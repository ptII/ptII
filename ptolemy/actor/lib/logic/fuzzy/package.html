The ptolemy.actor.lib.logic.fuzzy package.
<p>
The fuzzy logic actor in Ptolemy II uses Edward Sarzonov's Java Fuzzy Engine.  
Sarzonov's Java Fuzzy Engine is open source but it is not under a BSD license.</p>
<p>The FuzzyEngine distribution may be found at
<a href="http://people.clarkson.edu/~esazonov/FuzzyEngine.htm">http://people.clarkson.edu/~esazonov/FuzzyEngine.htm</a>.</p>
<p>The distribution itself is a zip file or a gzipped tar file that contains the
classes.  The classpath needs to be adjusted to point to the
proper directory.  <code>$PTII/configure</code> expects the FuzzyEngine
distribution to be at <code>$PTII/vendors/misc/FuzzyEngine</code>, though
it is possible to pass configure the <code>--with-fuzzyengine</code>
command line argument and then configure will look in that directory.</p>
<p>The installation procedure is:
<ul>
  <li>Change to the vendors/misc directory:
  <pre>
  cd $PTII
  mkdir -p vendors/misc
  cd vendors/misc
  <pre>
  <li>Download the distribution:
  <br>Windows:
  <pre>
  wget http://people.clarkson.edu/~esazonov/files/FuzzyEngine.zip
  unzip FuzzyEngine.zip
  </pre>
  Linux and Mac OS X:
  <pre>
  wget http://people.clarkson.edu/~esazonov/files/FuzzyEngine.tgz
  tar -zxf FuzzyEngine.tgz
  </pre>
  <li> Run configure:
  <pre>
  cd $PTII
  ./configure
  </pre>
  You should see
  <pre>
  checking for FuzzyEngine directory... ok
  </pre>
  and <code>$PTII/mk/ptII.mk</code> should be updated to point to the FuzzyEngine directory.
  </ul>
