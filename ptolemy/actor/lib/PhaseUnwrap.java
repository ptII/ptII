//// PhaseUnwrap

/**

 This actor unwraps a phase plot, removing discontinuities of
 magnitude 2*PI. The input is assumed to be a sequence of phases in
 radians in the range [-PI, PI].  The input and output types
 are double.  This actor assumes that the phase never
 changes by more than PI in one sample period. This is not a very
 sophisticated phase unwrapper, but for many applications, it does
 the job.
