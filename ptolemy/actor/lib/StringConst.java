//// StringConst

/**
 Produce a constant output of type string. This is similar to the base
 class Const, which can also produce a string output, but this has the
 added convenience that the string can be specified without the enclosing
 double quotes. Moreover, the string can include references to parameters
 within scope using the $name syntax. The value of the
 output is that of the token contained by the <i>value</i> parameter,
 which by default is an empty string.
