//// TimeDelay

/**
 This actor delays the input by a specified amount of time. It is designed
 to be used in timed domains such as DE. It can also be used
 in other domains, such as SR and SDF, but this will only be useful if the
 delay value is a multiple of the period of those directors. The amount
 of the time is required to be non-negative and has a default value 1.0.
 The input and output types are unconstrained, except that the output type
 must be the same as that of the input. It can be used in the Continuous
 domain, but it is really only useful to delay purely discrete signals.
 Because of the way variable-step-size ODE solvers work, the TimeDelay
 actor has the side effect of forcing the solver to use very small step
 sizes, which slows down a simulation.
 <p>
 This actor keeps a local FIFO queue to store all received but not processed
 inputs. The behavior of this actor on each firing is to read a token from
 the input, if there is one, store it into the local queue. It will
 also output any previously received token that is scheduled to be produced
 at the current time. If there is no previously received token scheduled
 to be produced, then the output will (implicitly) be absent.
 <p>
 If an input is read during the fire() method, then
 during the postfire() method, this actor schedules itself to fire again
 to produce the just received token on the corresponding output channel after
 the appropriate time delay. Note that if the value of delay is 0.0, the
 actor schedules itself to fire at the current model time.
 <p>
 This actor can be used to delay either discrete signals or continuous-time
 signals. However, in the latter case, some odd artifacts will inevitably
 appear if a variable step-size solver is being used. In particular, the
 output will be absent on any firing where there was no input at exactly
 time <i>t</i> - <i>d</i>, where <i>t</i> is the time of the firing
 and <i>d</i> is the value of the delay parameter.
 <p>
 Occasionally, this actor is useful with the
 delay parameter set to 0.0.  The time stamp of the output will
 equal that of the input, but there is a "microstep" delay.
 Several Ptolemy II domains use a "super dense" model
 of time, meaning that a signal from one actor to another can
 contain multiple events with the same time stamp. These events
 are "simultaneous," but nonetheless
 have a well-defined sequential ordering determined by the order
 in which they are produced.
 If \textit{delay} is 0.0, then the fire() method of this actor
 always produces on its output port the event consumed in the
 \textit{previous iteration} with the same time stamp, if there
 was one. If there wasn't such a previous iteration, then it
 produces no output.  Its postfire() method consumes and
 records the input for use in the next iteration, if there
 is such an input, and also requests a refiring at the current
 time.  This refire request triggers the next iteration (at
 the same time stamp), on which the output is produced.
 <p>
 A consequence of this strategy is that this actor is
 able to produce an output (or assert that there is no output) before the
 input with the same time is known.   Hence, it can be used to break
 causality loops in feedback systems. The Continuous director will leverage this when
 determining the fixed point behavior. It is sometimes useful to think
 of this zero-valued delay as an infinitesimal delay.
