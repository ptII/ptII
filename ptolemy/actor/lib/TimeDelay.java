//// TimeDelay

/**
 This actor delays the input by a specified amount of time given by
 the <i>delay</i> port or parameter, which defaults to 1.0. It is designed
 to be used in timed domains, particularly DE. It can also be used
 in other domains, such as SR and SDF, but this will only be useful if the
 delay value is a multiple of the period of those directors. The value
 of <i>delay</i> is required to be nonnegative. In addition, if the
 <i>delay</i> port is connected (and hence the delay will be variable
 at run time), then the values provided at the port are required to be
 greater than or equal <i>minimumDelay</i>,
 which defaults to 0.0. Setting the <i>minimumDelay</i> to something greater
 than 0.0 is helpful in specials domains such as Ptides.
 The input and output types are unconstrained, except that the output type
 must be the same as that of the input. 
 <p>
 Note that in Ptides the SuperdenseDependency is used for computing
 offsets and deadlines. The dependency between the input and the output
 of this actor is the <i>minimumDelay</i>. A <i>minimumDelay</i> of 
 values > 0.0 allows for more efficient execution of Ptides models. If
 this actor is used as a fixed delay actor, i.e. the delay value is not
 changed during the execution, the <i>minimumDelay</i> should be set to
 the actual delay. 
 <p>
 For directors that implement {@link SuperdenseTimeDirector}, such as
 DE, the output microstep of an event will match the input microstep,
 unless the time delay is 0.0, in which case, the output microstep will
 be one greater than the input microstep.
 A time delay of 0.0 is sometimes useful to break
 causality loops in feedback systems. It is sometimes useful to think
 of this zero-valued delay as an infinitesimal delay.
 <p>
 This actor keeps a local FIFO queue to store all received but not produced
 inputs. The behavior of this actor on each firing is to
 output any previously received token that is scheduled to be produced
 at the current time (and microstep).
 If there is no previously received token scheduled
 to be produced, then the output will be absent.
 <p>
 Inputs are read only during the postfire() method.
 If an input is present, then this actor schedules itself to fire again
 to produce the just received token on the corresponding output channel after
 the appropriate time delay. Note that if the value of delay is 0.0, the
 actor schedules itself to fire at the current model time, resulting in
 an output with an incremented microstep.
 <p>
 This actor can also be used in the Continuous
 domain, but it is only useful to delay purely discrete signals.
 As a consequence, for directors that implement {@link SuperdenseTimeDirector},
 this actor insists that input events have microstep 1 or greater.
 It will throw an exception if it receives an input with microstep 0,
 which in the Continuous domain, implies a continuous signal.
 There are two reasons for rejecting continuous inputs.
 First, because of the way variable-step-size ODE solvers work, the TimeDelay
 actor has the side effect of forcing the solver to use very small step
 sizes, which slows down a simulation.
 Second, and more important, some odd artifacts will
 appear if a variable step-size solver is being used. In particular, the
 output will be absent on any firing where there was no input at exactly
 time <i>t</i> - <i>d</i>, where <i>t</i> is the time of the firing
 and <i>d</i> is the value of the delay parameter. Thus, a continuous
 signal input will have gaps on the output, and will fail to be
 piecewise continuous.
