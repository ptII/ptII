/**
 <p>Compute the remainder after dividing the input by the divisor.
 The input and output data types are both double.
 This is implemented using the IEEEremainder() method of the java Math
 class, which computes the remainder as prescribed by the IEEE 754
 standard. The method documentation states:</p>
 <quote>
 "The remainder value is mathematically equal to f1 - f2 ? n, where n
 is the mathematical integer closest to the exact mathematical value
 of the quotient f1/f2, and if two mathematical integers are equally
 close to f1/f2, then n is the integer that is even. If the
 remainder is zero, its sign is the same as the sign of the first
 argument. Special cases:
 <ul>
 <li> If either argument is NaN, or the first argument is infinite,
 or the second argument is positive zero or negative zero,
 then the result is NaN.</li>
 <li> If the first argument is finite and the second argument is
 infinite, then the result is the same as the first argument."</li>
 </ul>
 </quote>

 <p>Note: The divisor parameter is available as an input port in
 the MathFunction.Modulo() method. If you need to change the divisor
 during run-time, the MathFunction actor may be the a better choice.</p>
