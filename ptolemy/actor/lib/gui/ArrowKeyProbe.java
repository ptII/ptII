/**
 Detect when the user presses or releases an arrow key and produce an
 integer on the corresponding output.

 <p>When this actor is preinitialized, it pops up a new JFrame window on
 the desktop, usually in the upper left hand corner of the screen.
 When this JFrame has the focus (such as when it has been clicked on)
 it is capable of sensing keystrokes.

 <p>This actor senses only the four non-numeric-pad arrow-key
 keystrokes.  This actor responds to key releases as well as key
 presses.  Upon each key press, the integer 1 is broadcast from the
 corresponding output.  Upon each key release, the integer 0 is output.

 <p>This actor contains a private inner class which generated the JFrame.
 The frame sets up call-backs which react to the keystrokes.  When called,
 these call the director's fireAtCurrentTime() method.  This causes
 the director to call fire() on the actor.   The actor then broadcasts
 tokens from one or both outputs depending on which keystroke(s) have
 occurred since the actor was last fired.

 <p>NOTE: This actor only works in the DE domain due to its reliance on
 this director's fireAtCurrentTime() method.
