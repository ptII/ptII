//// BarGraph

/**
 <p>A bar graph plotter.  This plotter contains an instance of the Plot
 class from the Ptolemy plot package as a public member. Data at
 the input, which can consist of any number of channels, are plotted
 on this instance.  Each input channel is plotted as a separate data set.
 Each input token is an array of doubles.</p>
 <p>
 The <i>iterationsPerUpdate</i> parameter can be used to fine tune
 the display.  It can be quite expensive to generate the display, and
 by default, this actor generates it on every firing.  If
 <i>iterationsPerUpdate</i> is set to some integer greater than
 one, then it specifies how many iterations should be executed
 between updates. Thus, if <i>iterationsPerUpdate</i> = 2, then every
 second time this actor fires, it will update the display. That is,
 it will update its display on the first firing, the third, the
 fifth, etc. It will, however, consume its inputs on every firing.
 The plot is always updated in the wrapup() method.</p>
