/**

 <p>An actor that stops execution of a model when it receives a true
 token on any input channel. This is accomplished by calling
 finish() on the director, which requests that the current iteration
 be completed and then the execution be halted. This actor will
 also call stopFire() which requests that any actors that are
 firing concurrently in separate threads conclude their firings.
 This is necessary to support threaded domains like PN. If the input
 is not connected to anything, then this actor requests a stop
 whenever it fires.

 </p><p>
 When exactly this stops the execution depends on the domain.  For
 example, in DE, if an event with time stamp <i>T</i> and value
 <i>true</i> arrives at this actor, then the current iteration will
 be concluded, and then the model will halt.  Concluding the current
 iteration means processing all events in the event queue with time
 stamp <i>T</i>. Thus, it is possible for actors to be invoked after
 this one is invoked with a <i>true</i> input.

 </p><p>
 In SDF, if this actor receives <i>true</i>, then the current
 iteration is concluded and then execution is stopped.  Similarly in
 SR.

 </p><p>
 In PN, where each actor has its own thread, there is no
 well-defined notion of an iteration. The finish() method of the
 manager calls stopFire() on all actors, which for threaded actors
 results in halting them upon their next attempt to read an input or
 write an output. When all actor threads have stopped, the iteration
 concludes and the model halts. <b>NOTE</b>: <i>This is not the best
 way to stop a PN model!</i> This mechanism is nondeterministic in
 the sense that there is no way to control exactly what data is
 produced or consumed on the connections before the model stops.  To
 stop a PN model, it is better to design the model so that all
 actors are starved of data when the model is to stop.  The director
 will detect this starvation, and halt the model.  Nonetheless, if
 the nondeterminism is acceptable, this actor can be used.</p>
