/**
 Base class for simple data sinks.  This class provides an input port,
 exposed as a public variable, and a clone method that ensures that the
 public variable is correctly set in the clone.  The main reason for this
 class to ensure that the input ports of all sinks have the same name
 and are correctly handled in cloned actors.
