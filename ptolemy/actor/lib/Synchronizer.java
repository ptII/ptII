//// Synchronizer

/**
 This actor implements a token synchronizer.  It has one input port and
 one output port, both of which are multiports.  When at least one token
 exists on every input channel, exactly one token is consumed from each
 input channel, and the tokens are output on the corresponding output
 channels.
 <p>
 Note that the ordering of channels of a multiport is determined by the
 order of connection.  Thus the n<sup>th</sup> input channel connected
 corresponds to the n<sup>th</sup> output channel connected.
