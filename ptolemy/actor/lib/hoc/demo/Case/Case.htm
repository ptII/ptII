Case is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "Case.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="CaseVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>This model shows how to use the Case actor.
Looking inside the Case actor will reveal that it
has three distinct refinements. Which one is executed
depends on the value of the control input provided to
it. In this example, the control value cycles through
the list {0, 1, 2, 3} repeatedly. The "0" refinement
is executed when the control is 0, the "1" refinement is
executed when the control is 1, and the "default" refinement
is executed otherwise.</p>
