<h1>MulticoreExecution</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>The ThreadedComposite actors in this model contain submodels that include an actor that performs
a fixed long-running computation and then outputs the real-time it took to perform that computation.
Since the two instances of ThreadedComposite run in separate threads, on a multicore machine this
model will execute faster than on a single core machine, and in fact will execute in less time than
the total aggregate computation time. The submodels compute and display the aggregate execution
time for their own submodel.</p>

<p>On a dual-core machine such as a Macbook Pro, this model executes approximately twice as fast
as it would if the composite actors were ordinary TypedCompositeActor rather than ThreadedComposite.</p>

<p>This example also illustrates that ThreadedComposite can be used with directors other than DE,
such as SR.</p>
