MulticoreExecution is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "MulticoreExecution.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="MulticoreExecutionVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>The ThreadedComposite actors in this model contain submodels that include an actor that performs
a fixed long-running computation and then outputs the real-time it took to perform that computation.
Since the two instances of ThreadedComposite run in separate threads, on a multicore machine this
model will execute faster than on a single core machine, and in fact will execute in less time than
the total aggregate computation time. The submodels compute and display the aggregate execution
time for their own submodel.</p>

<p>On a dual-core machine such as a Macbook Pro, this model executes approximately twice as fast
as it would if the composite actors were ordinary TypedCompositeActor rather than ThreadedComposite.</p>

<p>This example also illustrates that ThreadedComposite can be used with directors other than DE,
such as SR.</p>
