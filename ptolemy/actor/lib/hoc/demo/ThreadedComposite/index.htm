<h1>ThreadedComposite</h1>

The ThreadedComposite actor supports execution of either an atomic actor
or a composite actor in a separate thread. It thus brings multithreading
to Ptolemy domains where the director does not use threads, such as
DE, SR, and SDF.  The actor can be used to get parallel execution on
multicore machines, to execute actors that block on I/O without blocking
the model execution, and to execute actors in the background.
