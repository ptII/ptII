/**
 A container for another actor that executes that other actor
 in a separate thread called the <i>inside thread</i>.
 This actor starts that thread in its initialize()
 method, which is invoked by its executive director (the director
 in charge of firing this actor). The thread that invokes the
 action methods of this actor
 (initialize(), prefire(), fire(), postfire(), and wrapup())
 is called the <i>director thread</i>.
 <p>
 A paper describing the use of this actor is found at
 <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2008/EECS-2008-151.html">
 http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2008/EECS-2008-151.html</a>.
 <p>
 This actor automatically creates input and output ports to
 match those of the inside actor. Input events provided at those
 input ports are provided as input events to the contained actor.
 Outputs provided by the contained actor become output events
 of this actor. The time stamp of the input events is provided
 by the container of this actor. The time stamp of the output events
 depends on the <i>delay</i> parameter, as explained below.
 <p>
 The inside thread blocks waiting for inputs or pure events.
 Inputs are provided to that thread when the fire() method of
 this actor is invoked by the director thread.
 Pure events are provided after fireAt(),
 fireAtCurrentTime(), or fireAtFirstValidTimeAfter() are called
 by either the inside thread or the director thread.
 When the time of those firing requests becomes current time,
 the container will (presumably) fire this actor, and
 this actor will provide a pure event to the inside thread,
 causing it to fire the contained actor.
 <p>
 If the <i>synchronizeToRealTime</i> parameter is true, then
 when the inside thread encounters an input or pure event
 with time stamp <i>t</i>, it stalls until real time matches
 or exceeds <i>t</i> (measured in seconds since the start of
 execution of the inside thread). In contrast for example
 to the <i>synchronizeToRealTime</i> parameter of the DEDirector,
 this enables construction of models where only a portion of the
 model synchronizes to real time.
 <p>
 When the wrapup() method of this actor is called, the inside thread is
 provided with signal to terminate rather than to process additional
 inputs. The inside thread will also exit if stop() is called on this
 actor; however, in this case, which iterations are completed
 is nondeterminate (there may be inputs left unprocessed).
 <p>
 The parameters of this actor include all the parameters of the
 contained actor, and setting those parameters automatically
 sets the parameters of the contained actor.
 <p>
 In addition to the parameters of the contained actor, this actor
 has a <i>delay</i> parameter. This parameter is a double that
 be any nonnegative value or the special value <i>UNDEFINED</i>.
 If it is given a nonnegative value, then the value specifies
 the model-time delay between input events and the output
 events that result from reacting to those input events.
 That is, if this actor is given an input event with time
 stamp <i>t</i>, then if the contained actor produces any output
 events in reaction to that event, those output events will be
 produced by this actor with time stamp <i>t</i> + <i>delay</i>.
 <p>
 If <i>delay</i> has value <i>UNDEFINED</i>, then
 outputs are produced at the current model time of the executive
 director when the inside thread happens to produce those events,
 or if <i>synchronizeToRealTime</i>, at the greater of current
 model time and current real time (measured in seconds since
 the start of execution).
 This is accomplished by the inside thread calling
 fireAtFirstValidTimeAfter() of the enclosing director, and
 then producing the outputs when the requested firing occurs
 in the director thread. Note that with this value of the
 <i>delay</i>, it is possible for the inside thread to
 continue to execute and respond to input events after
 the wrapup phase of the director thread has been entered.
 The wrapup phase will stall until the inside thread has
 completed its processing of its inputs, but any outputs
 it produces after the wrapup phase has started will be
 discarded.
 <p>
 The most common use of this actor is in the DE domain,
 although it can also be used in CT, SR, SDF, and other domains,
 with some care. See the above referenced memo.
 Regardless of the value of <i>delay</i>, this actor is treated
 by DE as introducing a delay, much like the TimedDelay actor.
 In fact, if <i>delay</i> is 0.0, there will be a one tick delay
 in superdense time, just as with the TimedDelay actor.
 If the inside model also has a time delay (e.g. if you
 put a TimedDelay actor inside a ThreadedComposite), then
 the total delay is the sum of the two delays.
 <p>
 <b>Discussion:</b>
 <p>
 There are several useful things you can do with this model.
 We describe some use cases here:
 <p>
 <i>Background execution.</i> When <i>delay</i> is greater than
 or equal to 0.0,
 then when this actor is fired in response to input events
 with time stamp <i>t</i>, the actual
 processing of those events occurs later in a separate thread. The
 director thread is not blocked, and can continue to process events
 with time stamps less than or equal to <i>t</i> + <i>delay</i>.
 The director thread is blocked from processing events with larger
 time stamps than that because this is necessary to preserve DE
 semantics. To implement this, this actor uses fireAt() to
 request a firing at time  <i>t</i> + <i>delay</i>, and when that
 firing occurs, it blocks the director thread until the reaction
 is complete.
 <p>
 <i>Parallel firing.</i> Note that if <i>delay</i> is set to 0.0,
 it may seem that there is no point in using this actor, since
 model time will not be allowed to increase past <i>t</i> until
 the contained actor has reacted to events with time stamp <i>t</i>.
 However, there is actually exploitable concurrency if there
 are other actors in the model that also have pending input
 events with time stamp <i>t</i>. Those event can be processed
 concurrently with this actor reacting to its input event.
 A typical use case will broadcast an event to several instances
 of ThreadedComposite, in which case each of those several
 inside threads can execute concurrently in reaction to those
 input events.
 <p>
 <i>Real-time source.</i> If the contained actor (and hence this
 actor) has no inputs and <i>synchronizeToRealTime</i> is true, then
 the contained actor must call fireAt() or one of its variants so that
 the inside thread will be provided with pure events.
 The behavior depends on which variant of the fireAt() methods is used
 by the inside actor.  There are three cases:
 FIXME: Described these. In particular, delay needs to specify the
 minimum increment between these or fireAt() could result in an
 exception.  Do we want a parameter to relax that?
 <p>
 On subtlety of this actor is that it cannot expose instances of ParameterPort
 without introducing nondeterminacy in the execution. A ParameterPort 
 is an input port that sets the value of a parameter with the same name. Upon receiving
 a token at such a port, if this actor were to set a parameter visible by the
 inside thread, there is no assurance that the inside thread is not still
 executing an earlier iteration. Thus, it could appear to be sending a message
 backward in time, which would be truly bizarre. To prevent this error,
 this actor does not mirror such ports, and hence they appear on the outside
 only as parameters.
