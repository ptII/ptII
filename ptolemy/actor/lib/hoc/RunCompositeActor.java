/**
 This is a composite actor that can execute the contained model
 completely, as if it were a top-level model, on each firing.
 This can be used to define an actor whose firing behavior
 is given by a complete execution of a submodel.
 <p>
 An instance of this actor can have ports added to it.  If it has
 input ports, then on each firing, before executing the referenced
 model, this actor will read an input token from the input port, if
 there is one, and use it to set the value of a top-level parameter
 in the contained model that has the same name as the port, if there
 is one.  The simplest way to ensure that there is a matching parameter
 is to use a PortParameter for inputs.  However, this actor will work
 also for ordinary ports. In this case, if this actor has a
 parameter with the same name as the port, and it is an instance
 of Variable (or its derived class Parameter), then the token
 read at the input is moved into it using its setToken() method.
 Otherwise, if it is an instance of Settable, then a string representation
 of the token is copied using the setExpression() method.
 Input ports should not be multiports, and if they are, then
 all but the first channel will be ignored.
 <p>
 If this actor has output ports and the contained model is executed,
 then upon completion of that execution, if this actor has parameters
 whose names match those of the output ports, then the final value of
 those parameters is sent to the output ports. If such a parameter is an
 instance of Variable (or its derived class Parameter), then its
 contained token is sent to the output token. Otherwise, if it is an
 instance of Settable, then a string token is produced on the output
 with its value equal to that returned by getExpression() of the
 Settable. Output ports should not be multiports. If they are,
 then all but the first channel will be ignored.
 A typical use of this actor will use the SetVariable actor
 inside to define the value of the output port.
 <p>
 In preinitialize(), type constraints are set up so that input
 and output ports with (name) matching parameters are constrained
 to have compatible types. Note that if the ports or parameters
 are changed during execution, then it will be necessary to set
 up matching type constraints by hand.  Since this isn't possible
 to do from Vergil, the ports and parameters of this actor
 should not be changed using Vergil during execution.
 <p>
 This actor also overrides the requestChange() method and the
 executeChangeRequests() method to execute the given change. It does not
 delegate the change request to the container, but executes the request
 immediately or records it, depending on whether setDeferringChangeRequests()
 has been called with a true argument.
