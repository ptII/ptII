/**
 This port mirrors the properties of an associated port. That is,
 if either this port or the associated port is changed by
 setInput(), setOutput(), setMultiport(), or if it is removed
 by setContainer(null), or its name is changed by setName(),
 then the mirror port gets the same
 changes.  The changes are also applied to derived ports
 (ports that mirror this one because of the class mechanism).
 <p>
 Users of this class must override their clone(Workspace)
 method to re-establish appropriate port associations in
 the clone.  Cloning this port results in a clone with
 no associations.
