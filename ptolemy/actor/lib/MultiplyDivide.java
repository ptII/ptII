/**

 <p>A polymorphic multiplier and/or divider.  This adder has two input
 ports, both of which are multiports, and one output port, which is
 not.  The types on the ports are undeclared and will be resolved by
 the type resolution mechanism. Data that arrives on the input port
 named <i>multiply</i> will be multiplied, and data that arrives on
 the input port named <i>divide</i> will be divided.  Any token type
 supporting multiplication and division can be used.  In most
 domains, either input port can be left unconnected.  Thus, to get a
 simple multiplier (with no division), just leave the <i>divide</i>
 input unconnected.
 </p>
 <p>
 Currently, the type system is quite liberal about the resolved
 types it will permit at the inputs. In particular, it may permit
 the <i>multiply</i> and <i>divide</i> inputs to resolve to types
 that cannot in fact be multiplied or divided.  In these cases, a
 run-time error will occur.  In the future, we hope that the type
 system will intercept such errors before run time.
 </p>
 <p>
 This actor does not require that each input channel have a token
 upon firing. It will multiply or divide available tokens at the
 inputs and ignore the channels that do not have tokens.  It
 consumes at most one input token from each port.  If no input
 tokens are available on the <i>multiply</i> inputs, then a
 numerator of one is assumed for the division operations.  The "one"
 is obtained by calling the one() method of the first token seen at
 the <i>divide</i> input.  If no input tokens are available at all,
 then no output is produced.
