/**
 This is a marker interface for actors that operate on sequences.
 That is, logically, all signals observed or produced are sequences
 of tokens, where time is not significant, but the
 indexing of the token within the sequence may be.
 Actors that implement this marker interface may be disallowed
 in certain domains, like CT, where the number of tokens per
 unit time is unpredictable, and out of the control of the actor.
