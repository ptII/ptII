/**
 This actor provides a one-tick delay.  On each firing, it produces
 on the output port whatever value it read on the input port in the
 previous tick of the clock. If the input was absent on the previous
 tick of the clock, then the output will be absent. On the first tick,
 the output is <i>initialValue</i> if it is given, and absent otherwise.
 In contrast to the Pre actor, this actor is non-strict, and hence can
 break causality loops.  Whereas Pre provides a one-step delay of
 non-absent values, this actor simply delays by one clock tick.
