/**
 A register is a stateful actor with a trigger port that accepts
 read requests.
 <p>
 In the fire() method, if there is an event on the <i>trigger</i>
 input port, this actor will produce an output event. The value
 of the output event will be the previously recorded event
 from the <i>input</i> port, or the value of the <i>initialValue</i>
 parameter if there has been no previous input event. If, however,
 <i>initialValue</i> contains no value, then no output will be
 produced. In the postfire() method, if there is an input event on
 the <i>input</i> port, then its value is recorded to be used
 in future firings as the value of the output.
 <p>
 The inputs can be of any token type, but the <i>output</i> port
 is constrained to be of a type at least that of the <i>input</i>
 port and the <i>initialValue</i> parameter.
 <p>
 This class extends Sampler. Unlike its base class, this actor
 can be used to break dependencies in a feedback loop in that
 the input tokens are consumed from the input ports after the outputs
 are generated. Another difference is that the Register actor can be
 fired when either the trigger port or the input port has a token, while
 the Sampler can only be fired when the trigger port receives a token.
 <p>
 Both the <i>input</i> port and the <i>output</i> port are multiports.
 Generally, their widths should match. Otherwise, if the width of the
 <i>input</i> is greater than the width of the <i>output</i>, the extra
 input tokens will not appear on any output, although they will be
 consumed from the input port. If the width of the <i>output</i> is
 greater than that of the <i>input</i>, then the last few channels of
 the <i>output</i> will never emit tokens.
 <p>
 Note: If the width of the input changes during execution, then the
 most recent inputs are forgotten, as if the execution of the model
 were starting over.
