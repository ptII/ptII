//// MicrostepDelay

/**
 This actor delays the input by one microstep. The output is always
 absent in the first firing. This actor is designed
 to be used in domains where the director implements
 SuperdenseTimeDirector, like Continuous and DE.
 Inputs are read only during the postfire() method.
 If an input is present, then this actor schedules itself to fire again
 to produce the just received token on the corresponding output channel in
 the next microstep at the same time stamp.
 <p>
 When this actor is used in the Continuous domain, it requires that its 
 input be purely  discrete (specifically that it be absent at microstep 0).
 The reason for rejecting continuous inputs is that a continuous input
 would cause a stuttering Zeno condition, where time cannot advance.
