 Record all input tokens for later querying.

 <p>This actor differs from actor {@link ptolemy.actor.lib.Recorder}
 in that this actor has its input type set to BaseType.GENERAL.
 This actor is used to test the type constraints of the
 Display actor, which is more difficult to test because it is a graphical
 actor.
