//// DatagramReader

/**
 This actor reads datagram packets via a separate thread.  The thread
 responds to datagrams whenever they arrive, giving the actor the ability
 to read the datagrams asynchronously.


 Datagrams are connectionless, open-loop internet communications.  Each
 datagram packet contains data plus a return address.  The return
 address consists of an IP address and a socket number.  Datagrams use
 the UDP protocol under which no reply or confirmation is expected.
 This is in contrast to TCP which expects confirmations and attempts to
 deliver packets in order to the layer above TCP.  This can result in
 long delays in the delivery of information across the network.  Because
 UDP makes no such attempts, it never hangs and does not need to be timed out.

 <p>NOTE: This actor has been developed to work in the Discrete Event
 (DE) and Synchronous Data Flow (SDF) domains.  Use elsewhere with
 caution.

 <p>NOTE: This actor has problems, the tests do not reliably pass.
 For details, see <a href="https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54"><code>https://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54</code></a>.

 <p> <p>The simplest scenario has the thread constantly stalled
 awaiting a packet.  When a packet arrives, the thread quickly queues
 it in one of the buffers of the actor, calls the
 getDirector().fireAtCurrentTime(), and then stalls again awaiting the
 next packet.  By stalling again and again, the thread keeps the actor
 aware at all times of incoming packets.  This is particularly
 important if packets come in more quickly than the model can process
 them.  Depending on the domain (e.g. DE) in which this actor is used,
 the director may respond to the fireAtCurrentTime() call of the thread by
 calling the fire() method of the actor.  In this case, fire() then
 broadcasts the data received, along with the return address and return
 socket number from which the datagram originated.

 <p>The data portion of the packet is broadcast at the <i>output</i> port.
 The type of the output is always an array of bytes.

 <p>The return address and socket number are broadcast as String and int
 respectively.  These tell where the received datagram originated from.

 <p>The behavior of the actor under less simple scenarios is governed by
 parameters of this actor.  Additional packet(s) can arrive while the
 director is getting around to calling fire().  Conversely, the
 director may make extra calls to fire(), even before any datagrams
 have come in.  I call these the eager packet and eager director
 scenarios respectively.

 <p>Background: There are two packet buffers.  The thread and the fire()
 method share these buffers and maintain consistency via synchronization
 on the object <i>_syncFireAndThread</i>.  This synchronization prevents
 conflicts when accessing the shared buffers and when accessing the
 count of queued packets.

 <p>The <i>overwrite</i> parameter applies to the eager packet
 scenario.  Setting this parameter to true is useful in cases where it
 is possible for data to come in too fast for the model to process.
 This setting alleviates data gluts without undue loss of data when the
 model is able to keep up.  When <i>overwrite</i> is set to true (the
 default), the actor discards the packet already received in
 favor of the new packet.  If false, the new packet is queued behind the
 existing one.  In the latter case, both buffers are now full.  The
 thread then waits for fire() to consume a queued packet before it
 stalls again awaiting the next.  In all other cases (<i>overwrite</i>
 true or no queued packets) the thread immediately stalls to await the
 next packet.

 <p>The <i>blockAwaitingDatagram</i> parameter applies to the eager
 director case.  This case comes up most often in SDF, where an actor
 is expected to block in fire until an output can be produced.  If
 true, a call to fire() will block unless or until a datagram has
 arrived.  If false, then fire() returns without waiting, using the
 <i>defaultOutput</i> parameter in place of real data.  The
 <i>returnAddress</i> and <i>returnSocketNumber</i> ports have default
 outputs as well, but they are not parameter-programmable.

 <p>
 <p>NOTE: This actor has a parameter <i>localSocketNumber</i> for the port
 number assigned to its local datagram socket.  Initially, the local
 socket number is set to 4004.  There is no particular reason for choosing
 this number, except that is noticeable in the code and in Vergil, thus
 encouraging you to change it to any desired value in the range 0..65535.
 Note that socket numbers 0..1023 are generally reserved and numbers 1024 and
 above are generally available.

 <p>Some commonly used port numbers (a.k.a. socket numbers) are shown below:

 <p>NOTE: This actor can also be configured to handle multicase datagram
 socket. A MulticastSocket is a DatagramSocket with additional capabilities
 to join groups of other multicast hosts on the internet. A multicast group
 is specified by a class D IP address and a standard UDP port number.
 When one member sends a packet to a multicast group, all recipients
 subscribing to that host and port receive the packet.
 Currently, The parameter <i>defaultReturnAddress</i> is overloaded to specify
 a multicast datagram IP address. When the return address is a multicast IP
 address, The parameter <i>localSocketNumber</i> is used to specify the
 UDP port number for the multicast group. A multicast IP address
 ranges from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255, inclusive. To send a packet to the
 group, the sender can be either a DatagramSocket or a MulticastSocket. The
 only difference is that MulticastSocket allows you to control the time-to-live
 of the datagram. Don't use 224.0.0.1 ~ 224.255.255.255 when the live time of
 is specified larger than 1.

 <p>FIXME: we might not want to overload the <i>defaultReturnAddress</i> and
 the <i>localSocketNumber</i> parameter...

 <p>Another useful tidbit is the command 'netstat'.  This works in a
 DOS prompt and also in the UNIX-like Bash shell.  In either shell,
 enter 'netstat -an'.  This command shows current port allocations!  Ports
 allocated to Ptolemy models are shown along with other port allocations.
 Other useful network commands include 'ping' and 'tracert'.
 Both TCP and UDP (datagram) ports are shown by netstat.
 FIXME: Find out whether a TCP port using a specific number blocks a
 UDP port from using that same number.

     *  fire() again and the actor will start again in a consistent
     *  state.  The fire() method uses a wait() call to block.  If
     *  fire() not currently blocked, it is permitted to continue.
     *  This could be before or after the wait() call.  If it has
     *  passed the wait() statement, it will complete.  However, if it
     *  has not yet reached the wait() statement, it will block
     *  anyway.  Thus, when pausing or stopping execution, it will on
     *  rare occasion be necessary to press 'pause' or 'stop' a second
     *  time.
     *
     *  I tried to clean this up, so that one, and exactly one,
     *  stopFire() call would suffice.  These experiments and some
     *  thought about them are discussed below.  However, the bottom
     *  line is that any approach which stopped fire() in each case
     *  where it ought to be stopped, also stopped it in some
     *  additional cases where it ought not be stopped.
     *
     *  This is a very interesting predicament!  One could say the
     *  problem in an incompatibility of system-level types.  The type
     *  provided to the actor collectively by the Manager,
     *  CompositeActor, and Director is a call-return type of
     *  interface.  That is, stopFire() is called, and it is expected
     *  to return.  However, what may be needed is an interrupt type
     *  of interface.  One difference is that an interrupt comes with
     *  a flag that can be tested via the interrupted() and
     *  isInterrupted() methods.  Such a flag would solve the
     *  immediate problem with stopFire().  However, I wonder how we
     *  could be habitually applying the theory of system-level types
     *  and/or interface automata theory here and elsewhere?  Could we
     *  be building clearer designs from the get go?  Could the
     *  designs self modify or type-check themselves to maintain
     *  consistency as changes are made?  I am intrigued by the
     *  possibilities!
     *
     *  I did a bit of nosing around and discovered how stopFire()
     *  gets called.  The Manager initiates the call on the
     *  CompositeActor.  It then calls stopFire() on the Director.
     *  The Director fans out the call to every actor below it.
     *
     *  The director/manager insists on calling fire() after every
     *  call of prefire().  Even when it has issued a stopFire()
     *  during prefire(), it persists, executing the very fire() it is
     *  trying to stop!  This behavior makes it impossible for the
     *  actor to cover all the cases where it ought to stop.  See
     *  detailed discussion below.  Fortunately, multiple presses of
     *  the 'pause' and 'stop' buttons result in multiple stopFire()
     *  calls.  By the time a user can click the mouse a second time,
     *  fire() will have blocked if it is going to do so.  It can then
     *  be stopped as expected.
     *
     *  FIXME: There exists a circumstance where stopFire() could fail
     *  to stop the fire() method, and the fire() method could block
     *  indefinitely.  This occurs if stopFire() is called after
     *  fire() is called (or after the director commits itself to
     *  calling fire()) but before fire() enters the synchronized
     *  section in which it blocks with a wait() call.  In theory,
     *  fire() should avoid this by testing a flag before waiting.
     *  Such a flag could be set by stopFire().  However, there is no
     *  way for the actor to tell whether the flag was set during (or
     *  just before) this firing (in which case it ought to be
     *  obeyed), or if it was set during the completion of the last
     *  firing or when the actor was not being fired at all (in which
     *  case it ought to be ignored).  What is needed is a flag which
     *  is set when stopFire() is called, and cleared before the
     *  director commits to calling fire().
     *
     *  Perhaps prefire() could serve to clear the flag!  This assumes
     *  that, upon resuming execution, prefire() is repeated before
     *  fire() is reentered.-[Tested; assumption holds.]  It also
     *  assumes that superfluous calls to stopFire() do not occur
     *  during prefire() or between prefire() and fire().-[Tested;
     *  assumption holds with only known superfluous call, the one
     *  when the user presses 'Go'] Additionally, this assumes that
     *  intentional calls to stopFire(), if they occur before or
     *  during the [pre]initialize call, are backed up by a test which
     *  prevents the director from calling fire() if it has already
     *  called stopFire() with the intention of stopping that same
     *  fire().-[Tested; assumption does not hold.  I caused
     *  stopFire() to be called during prefire().  The director
     *  went ahead and called fire() anyway!]
     *
     *  If the director/manager need to be fixed anyway, perhaps the
     *  stopFire paradigm ought to be rearchitected to incorporate a
     *  flag.  (Does it already and I just don't know about it?)
