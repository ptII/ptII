//// BranchController

/**
 A BranchController manages the execution of a set of branch objects by
 monitoring whether the branches have blocked. A branch blocks when it is
 either unable to get data from its producer receiver or put data into its
 consumer receiver. When a branch blocks, it registers the block with its
 branch controller by passing the specific receiver that is blocked. If all
 of a branch controllers branches are blocked, then the branch controller
 informs the director associated with its containing composite actors.
 <P>
 Branches are assigned to a branch controller by the director associated
 with the controller's composite actor via the addBranches() method. This
 method takes an io port and determines the port's receivers. Branches
 are then instantiated and assigned to the receivers according to whether
 the receivers are producer or consumer receivers.
