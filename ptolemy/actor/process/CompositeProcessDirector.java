/**
 A baseclass for directors in process oriented domains that incorporate
 hierarchical heterogeneity. As with ProcessDirector
 CompositeProcessDirectors need to keep a count of the number of active
 processes and the number of processes that are blocked for any reason
 (e.g., trying to read from an empty channel in PN).
 CompositeProcessDirector is a subclass of ProcessDirector to facilitate
 models that consist of non-atomic actors.
 <P>
 A composite process director can be contained by an opaque composite
 actor that is contained by a composite actor. Ports contained by opaque
 composite actors are called opaque ports and such ports facilitate data
 transfer across the composite actor boundaries. A composite process
 director allocates two branch controllers to monitor data transfer in
 channels associated with opaque ports. The <I>input</I> branch controller
 monitors data transfer for channels associated with input opaque ports.
 The <I>output</I> branch controller monitors data transfer for channels
 associated with output opaque ports.
 <P>
 Associated with the channels of each opaque port is a pair of process
 receivers. The <I>producer receiver</I> serves as the channel source
 and the <I>consumer receiver</I> serves as the channel destination.
 Each branch controller allocates a branch for each process receiver
 pair and when executing, a branch repeatedly attempts to transfer a
 single token from its producer receiver to its consumer receiver.
 <P>
 When a branch blocks while attempting to transfer data, it informs its
 branch controller by passing the branch controller the blocked receiver.
 If all of the branches of a controller have blocked, then we say that
 the branch controller is blocked and the branch controller informs the
 composite process director. In addition to monitoring the status of its
 branch controllers, a composite process director keeps track of the
 state of the actors that it contains. Actors can be internally or
 externally blocked. We say that an actor is externally blocked if it
 is blocked waiting to transfer tokens to or from a boundary port of
 its container actor. Actors that are blocked but not externally are
 said to be internally blocked.
 <P>
 Composite process directors monitor the state of the branch controllers
 and contained actors and when necessary invoke the _resolveDeadlock()
 method to deal with deadlocks. In the remainder of this paragraph we
 consider the case of a process-oriented opaque composite actor that is
 contained by another process-oriented opaque composite actor. If the
 actors contained by the inner composite actor are not blocked, then
 execution of the inner composite actor is allowed to continue
 independent of the state of the branch controllers. If the actors
 contained by the inner composite actor are internally blocked, then
 after the branch controllers have been deactivated, execution of the
 composite actor ends and postfire returns false indicating that
 successive iterations are not allowed. If the actors contained by the
 inner composite actor are externally blocked, then the composite
 process director waits until the branch controllers block (an
 inevitable condition) and registers the block with the containing
 (outer) composite director of the actor.
 <P>
 In this paragraph we consider the case of a process-oriented opaque
 composite actor that is contained by a schedule-oriented (non process)
 opaque composite actor. If the actors contained by the inner composite
 actor are not blocked, then execution of the inner composite actor is
 allowed to continue independent of the state of the branch controllers.
 If the actors contained by the inner composite actor are internally
 blocked, then after the branch controllers have been deactivated,
 execution of the composite actor ends and postfire returns false
 indicating that successive iterations are not allowed. If the actors
 contained by the inner composite actor are externally blocked, then
 the composite process director waits until the branch controllers
 block (an inevitable condition) and ends the iteration with postfire()
 returning true indicating that successive iterations are allowed.
