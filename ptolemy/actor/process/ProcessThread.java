/**
 Thread class acting as a process for process oriented domains.
 <P>
 In process oriented domains, each actor acts as a separate process and
 its execution is not centrally controlled by the director. Each process
 runs concurrently with other processes and is responsible for calling
 its execution methods.
 <P>
 This class provides the mechanism to implement the above.
 An instance of this class can be created by passing an actor as an
 argument to the constructor. This class runs as a separate thread on
 being started and calls the execution methods on the actor, repeatedly.
 Specifically, it calls initialize(), and then repeatedly calls
 the prefire(), fire() and postfire() methods
 of the actor. Before termination, this calls the wrapup() method of
 the actor.
 <P>
 If an actor returns false in its postfire() methods, the actor is
 never fired again and the thread or process terminates after calling
 wrapup() on the actor.
 <P>
 An instance of this class is associated with an instance of
 ProcessDirector as well as an instance of Actor. The
 _increaseActiveCount() of the director is called from the constructor
 of this class, and the _decreaseActiveCount() method is called at the
 end of the run() method, just before the thread terminates.
