/**
 A Branch transfers tokens through a channel that crosses a composite
 actor boundary. Branch implements the Runnable class and the execution
 of a branch object is controlled by an instantiation of the
 BranchController class. Each branch object is assigned two receiver
 objects and each of these receiver objects must implement the
 ProcessReceiver class. One of the assigned receivers is referred to as
 the producer receiver (the channel source) and the other is referred to
 as the consumer receiver (the channel destination).
 <P>
 During its execution a branch attempts to get data from the producer
 receiver and put data in the consumer receiver. The communication
 semantics of the producer receiver get() method are dependent upon the
 model of computation associated with the producer receiver. In cases
 where a blocking read occurs, the producer receiver registers the block
 with the calling branch leading to a blocked branch. So that the producer
 receiver knows which branch to register the block with, a branch always
 invokes the receiver's get() method by passing itself as an argument.
 A blocked branch registers the block with the branch controller that it
 is assigned to.
 <P>
 Putting data in a consumer receiver is symmetrically analogous to getting
 data from a producer receiver. In cases where a blocking write occurs,
 the consumer receiver registers the block with the calling branch leading
 to a blocked branch. So that the consumer receiver knows which branch to
 register the block with, a branch always invokes the receiver's put()
 method by passing itself as an argument.
