/**
 A ProcessReceiver is an interface for receivers in the process oriented
 domains. It adds methods to the Receiver interface for setting flags that
 indicate whether a termination of the simulation has been requested.
 In addition, methods are available to accommodate hierarchical
 heterogeneity via composite actors.
 <P>
 In process oriented domains, simulations are normally ended on the
 detection of a deadlock. During a deadlock, processes or the
 corresponding threads are normally waiting on a call to some
 methods (for reading or writing) on a receiver.
 To terminate or end the simulation, these methods should
 either return or throw an exception to inform the processes that they
 should terminate themselves. For this a method requestFinish() is defined.
 This method would set a local flag in the receivers and wake up all the
 processes waiting on some call to the receiver. On waking up these
 processes would see that the termination flag set and behave accordingly.
 A sample implementation is <BR>
 <Code>
 public synchronized void requestFinish() {
 _terminate = true;
 notifyAll();
 }
 </code>
 <P>
 <P>
 To accommodate hierarchical heterogeneity, an instantiation of
 ProcessReceiver must be able to determine its topological location
 with respect to boundary ports. A boundary port is an opaque port
 that is contained by a composite actor. This ability is enforced
 with the isConnectedToBoundary(), isConnectedToBoundaryOutside(),
 isConnectedToBoundaryInside(), isInsideBoundary() and isOutsideBoundary()
 methods. For convenience, the BoundaryDetector class is available to
 to simplify the implementation of these methods.
 <P>
 Blocking reads and writes are accommodated via the get(Branch)
 and put(Token, Branch) methods. In cases where a branch attempts
 to get data from or put data into a process receiver, it calls,
 respectively, these methods by passing itself as an argument.
 The process receiver then knows to register any blocks with
 the branch rather than with a director as is occurs in non-composite
 cases.
 <P>
 Note that it is not necessary for an implementation of ProcessReceiver to
 be used in the ports of an opaque composite actor. It is perfectly fine
 for a ProcessReceiver implementation to be used in the ports of an atomic
 actor. In such cases the get() and put() methods are called without the
 use of a branch object. If blocking reads or writes occur they are
 registered with the controlling director without the need for a branch
 or branch controller.
