//// ProcessDirector

/**
 The base class for directors for the process oriented domains. It provides
 default implementations for methods that are common across such domains.
 <P>
 In the process oriented domains, the director controlling a model
 needs to keep track of the state of the model. In particular it needs
 to maintain an accurate count of the number of active processes under
 its control and any processes that are blocked for whatever reason (trying
 to read from an empty channel as in PN).
 These counts, and perhaps other counts, are needed by the
 director to control and respond when deadlock is detected (no processes
 can make progress), or to respond to requests from higher in the hierarchy.
 <P>
 The methods that control how the director detects and responds to deadlocks
 are _areActorsDeadlocked() and _resolveDeadlock(). These methods should be
 overridden in derived classes to get domain-specific behaviour. The
 implementations given here are trivial and suffice only to illustrate
 the approach that should be followed.
 <P>
 This base class is not sufficient for executing hierarchical, heterogeneous
 models. In order to accommodate hierarchical, heterogeneity the subclass
 CompositeProcessDirector must be used.
