//// NotifyThread

/**
 Helper thread for calling notifyAll() on a single lock or a LinkedList
 of locks. Since this is a new thread without any locks, calling notifyAll
 from this thread reduces the possibility of deadlocks.
 <p>
 To use this to wake up any threads waiting on a lock, create a new instance
 of this class with a LinkedList of lock objects (or single lock) to call
 notifyAll() on.
