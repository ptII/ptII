/**
 An event that is published by directors whenever an actor is activated.
 An activation occurs whenever an actor is prefired, fired, or
 postfired.  The appropriate event should be published just before
 or after the associated method of the executable interface is
 called.  The iterate event is published by those directors which
 vectorize firings of a particular actor.  This event may be
 published instead of many individual prefire, fire and postfire
 events.  As an example of how to implement a director that
 publishes these events, see the SDF Director.
 One way in which these events are used is to trace the firings of
 different actors.  A user interface can also implement a breakpoint
 mechanism by pausing execution of the executing thread in response
 to one of these events.

 <p>
 Note that since most directors work with a constant set of actors, and fire
 them repeatedly, it may improve efficiency dramatically to use a
 flyweight design pattern with firing events.  This can result in greatly
 reducing the load on the garbage collector.
