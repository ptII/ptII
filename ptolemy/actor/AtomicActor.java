//// AtomicActor

/**
 An AtomicActor is an executable entity that cannot itself contain
 other actors. The Ports of AtomicActors are constrained to be IOPorts.
 Derived classes may further constrain the ports by overriding the public
 method newPort() to create a port of the appropriate subclass, and the
 protected method _addPort() to throw an exception if its argument is a
 port that is not of the appropriate subclass. In this base class, the
 actor does nothing in the action methods (prefire, fire, ...).
