/**
 This interface defines the <i>action methods</i>, which determine
 how an object can be invoked. It should be implemented by actors
 and directors. In an execution of an application,
 the preinitialize() and initialize() methods should be
 invoked exactly once, followed by any number of iterations, followed
 by exactly one invocation of the wrapup() method. An <i>iteration</i>
 is defined to be any number of invocations of prefire() and fire(),
 where fire() is invoked only if prefire() returns true, followed by
 exactly one invocation of the postfire() method.
 The postfire() method returns false if no further iterations
 should occur. The initialize(), fire() and postfire() methods may produce
 output data.  The preinitialize() method runs
 before type resolution has been done, and is permitted to make
 changes in the topology of the model.
