//// TypedIOPort

/**
 An IOPort with a type. This class implements the Typeable interface.
 The type is represented by an instance of Type in data.type package.
 It can be declared by calling setTypeEquals(). If this method is not
 called, or called with a BaseType.UNKNOWN argument, the type of this port
 will be set by type resolution using the type constraints. The type
 constraints on this port can be specified using the methods defined in
 the Typeable interface.

 <p>This class keeps a list of TypeListeners. Whenever the type
 changes, this class will generate an instance of TypeEvent and pass it
 to the listeners by calling their typeChanged() method. A TypeListener
 register its interest in the type change event of this port by calling
 addTypeListener(), and can be removed from the listener list by calling
 the removeTypeListener().

 <p>A TypedIOPort can only link to instances of TypedIORelation. Derived
 classes may further constrain links to a subclass of TypedIORelation.
 To do this, they should override the protected methods _link() and
 _linkInside() to throw an exception if their arguments are not of the
 appropriate type.  Similarly, an TypeIOPort can only be contained by a
 class derived from ComponentEntity and implementing the TypedActor
 interface.  Subclasses may further constrain the containers by overriding
 _checkContainer().

 <p>Note that actors that call some of the setType<i>XXX</i> methods
 may also need to have a clone() method.  Although the base classes
 neatly handle most aspects of the clone operation, there are
 subtleties involved with cloning type constraints. Absolute type
 constraints on ports and parameters are carried automatically into the
 clone, so clone() methods should never call setTypeEquals(). However,
 relative type constraints of the other setType<i>XXX</I>() methods are
 not cloned automatically because of the difficulty of ensuring that
 the other object being referred to in a relative constraint is the
 intended one.
 <p> For example the Ramp actor constructor calls:
 <pre>
 output.setTypeAtLeast(init);
 </pre>
 so the clone() method of the Ramp actor calls:
 <pre>
 newObject.output.setTypeAtLeast(newObject.init);
 </pre>
