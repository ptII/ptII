//// TokenGotEvent

/**
 An event that is published by IOPorts whenever get or
 getInside is called.  The appropriate event should be published
 whenever a token is taken out from the port's queue by the actor code.
 In Kepler the provenance recorder uses these events to save
 intermediate results of the workflow.  In the future these events
 could be used for "smart" reruns or a fault tolerance mechanism.
