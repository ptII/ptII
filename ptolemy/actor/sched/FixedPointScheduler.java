/**
 A scheduler for the FixedPointDirector.  This scheduler constructs
 a static schedule for a model by performing a topological sort on
 actors. Currently, in this class, each actor appears only once, but
 a more sophisticated scheduler may mention an actor more
 than once if the dependencies require it.
