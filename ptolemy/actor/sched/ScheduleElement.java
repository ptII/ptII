//// ScheduleElement

/**
 This is an abstract base class for a schedule element. Instances of the
 Schedule and Firing subclasses are used to construct a static schedule.
 A schedule can be thought of as a structure that consists of an iteration
 count and a list of schedule elements. A schedule element can contain
 an actor, or it can contain another schedule. It is usually required that,
 all of the lowest-level schedule elements must contain an actor. It is
 up to the scheduler to enforce this, however. The Schedule class is a
 schedule element that contains a schedule. The Firing class is a schedule
 element that contains an actor. Therefore,
 the top-level schedule element must be an instance of Schedule, and all
 of the lowest-level elements must each be an instance of Firing.
 <p>
 This base class implements the getIterationCount() and setIterationCount()
 methods, which return and set the iteration count for this schedule element.
 A default value of 1 is used for the iteration count.
