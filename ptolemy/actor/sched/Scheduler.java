/**
 The base class for schedulers. A scheduler schedules the execution
 order of the containees of a CompositeActor.  <p>

 A scheduler is contained by a StaticSchedulingDirector, and provides
 the schedule for it.  The director will use this schedule to govern
 the execution of a CompositeActor. <p>

 A schedule is represented by the Schedule class, and determines the
 order of the firing of the actors in a particular composite actor.  In
 this base class, the default schedule fires the deeply
 contained actors in the order of their construction.  A domain specific
 scheduler will override this to provide a different order. <p>

 The schedule, once constructed, is cached and reused as long as the
 schedule is still valid.  The validity of the schedule is set by the
 setValid() method.  If the current schedule is not valid, then the
 schedule will be recomputed the next time the getSchedule() method is
 called.  However, derived classes will usually override only the
 protected _getSchedule() method. <p>

 The scheduler does not perform any mutations, and it does not listen
 for changes in the model.  Directors that use this scheduler should
 normally invalidate the schedule when mutations occur.
