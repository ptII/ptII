//// TokenGotListener

/**
 A TokenGotListener listens for events that are issued during the
 get(),  and getInside() function calls of an IOPort.  In
 general, an object that implements this interface will be collecting
 tokens for storage.
 <p>
 Currently this class is being used in Kepler by the
 ProvenanceExecutionListener for saving tokens with provenance
 information.  In the future, listeners will use this interface
 to save tokens in a cache for use during "smart" reruns or for
 fault tolerance.
