/**
 An event that is published by IOPorts whenever broadcast, send or
 sendInside is called.  The appropriate event should be published
 whenever a token is transfered from one port to another.  In
 Kepler the provenance recorder uses these events to save
 intermediate results of the workflow.  In the future these events
 could be used for "smart" reruns or a fault tolerance mechanism.
