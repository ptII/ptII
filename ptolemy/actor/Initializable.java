/**
 This interface defines a subset of the <i>action methods</i> for initialization
 and wrapup. It should be implemented by objects that do not need to invoked
 during runtime, but should be invoked in preinitialize() (exactly once,
 prior to type resolution), in initialize() (which could happen repeatedly during
 execution), or wrapup() (exacty once, at the end of execution).
