/**
 Interface of NamedObjs that correspond to criteria. Such NamedObjs are created
 as a result of those criteria, rather than having criteria associated with them
 as other NamedObjs. For example, a {@link PortMatcher} could be created
 automatically as a result of a port criterion. In that case, the PortMatcher
 should implement this interface, and define the {@link #getCriterion()} method
 to return that criterion.
