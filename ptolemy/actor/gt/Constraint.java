/**
 Constraint used to restrict pattern matching in model transformations. A
 constraint contains an expression that must be evaluable into a boolean at the
 time the transformation rule is applied. When the expression is specified at
 design time, it is parsed and a syntax tree is generated. If the parsing is not
 successful, a design time exception occurs. If the parse is successful, the
 constraint is evaluated every time a match to the pattern is found. No
 exception will be shown at the time of pattern matching even if the constraint
 cannot be successfully evaluated. In that case, the constraint will only be
 considered <tt>false</tt>. A constraint is satisfied if and only if it can be
 successfully evaluated and the result is boolean <tt>true</tt>.
