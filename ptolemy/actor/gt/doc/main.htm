<h1>Graph/Model Transformation (GT)</h1>

<p>The model transformation facility provides a framework for the
analysis and transformation of actor models using model transformation
techniques.

<p>The design of large-scale models poses a number of challenges. As
the size of the models increases to thousands of actors or hundreds of
thousands of actors, analysis and consistent modification on the
models become extremely hard. Furthermore, to maximize component
reuse, a systematic approach is needed for the specification and
maintenance of common patterns in the models and the transformation of
those patterns.

<p>The model transformation framework to be developed in this project
aims to support the flexible specification of patterns and
replacements by means of rules in graph grammar. An intuitive
graphical user interface will be built. For novice users, a set of
common transformations will be included in a library to facilitate
their common tasks.

<p>The transformations are models in their own right. They can be
embedded in larger models hierarchically. Heterogeneous models of
computation can be used to control the application of individual
"atomic" transformations. This makes it easy to create sophisticated
transformations by composing simple ones in a manageable and
disciplined way. The sophisticated transformations will also take
advantage of the concurrency inherent in those models of computation.

<p>Model transformation can be applied as an optimization of modal
models. These are hierarchical state machines with refinements in
their states, which are sub-models to be executed when those states
are active. The current implementation includes the complete
description of each refinement in the model description, even though
refinements of the states in a state machine tend to have large
commonality. With the transformation technique, only one refinement
needs to be stored completely. The others are obtained by
transformations performed on the stored refinement. This eliminates
redundancy and eases the job of modifying multiple refinements
consistently.

<p>Other applications of the model transformation technique include
recognizing common design patterns in the models in a static analysis,
replacing exiting design patterns with more efficient ones, and
reusing design patterns by incorporating them into new models.
