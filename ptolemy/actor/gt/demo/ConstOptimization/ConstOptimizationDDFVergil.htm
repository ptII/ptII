<h1>ConstOptimizationDDF</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>    This model demonstrates how one can optimize a model. The original input is the model in
BaseModel.xml, which the FileReader reads in. The contents of this model are then converted into an
ActorToken by the ModelGenerator. OptimizeOnce is a transformation rule that gets repeatedly applied
to this model until no further optimization is possible (i.e., a fixpoint is reached). In each application, two
Consts that are wired to an AddSubtract actor, a MultiplyDivide actor, or a Maximum actor are replaced
by a single Const with the statically computed value.
    ConstOptimization.xml in the same directory contains a DE model that has exactly the same
functionality, but has a much simpler design for using a Ptera TransformationController.</p>
