/**
 This is an interface for directors that use a superdense model of time.
 Actors can determine the index, also called the microstep,
 of current time by calling getIndex().
 <p>
 Superdense time is defined by Haiyang Zheng as:
 <blockquote>
 <p>"The interactions between CT and DE subsystems and between DE
 subsystems themselves are captured by discontinuities in
 continuous-time signals and simultaneous discrete events in
 discrete-event signals."</p>

 <p>"In order to precisely represent them in compute execution
 results, a two-dimension domain, called "superdense time," is used
 as the domain for defining signals. This domain allows a signal to
 have multiple values at the same time point while keeping the values
 ordered."</p>
