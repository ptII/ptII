//// TypedAtomicActor

/**
 A TypedAtomicActor is an AtomicActor whose ports and parameters have types.
 <p>
 The typeConstraints() method returns the type constraints among
 the contained ports and parameters.  This base class provides a default
 implementation of this method, which should be suitable for most of the
 derived classes.
 <p>
 Derived classes may constrain the container by overriding
 _checkContainer(). The Ports of TypedAtomicActors are constrained to be
 TypedIOPorts.  Derived classes may further constrain the ports by
 overriding the public method newPort() to create a port of the
 appropriate subclass, and the protected method _addPort() to throw an
 exception if its argument is a port that is not of the appropriate
 subclass.
