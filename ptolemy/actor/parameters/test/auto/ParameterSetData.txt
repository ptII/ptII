# This file defines parameters in the current container.
# Each non-comment line in the file is interpreted as a separate assignment.
# The lines are of the form:
# attributeName = value
# where variableName is the name of the attribute
# in a format suitable for ptolemy.kernel.util.NamedObj.setName()
# (i.e., does not contain periods) and value is
# the expression in the Ptolemy expression language.
# Comments are lines that begin with the # character.
# FIXME: After saving, you need to update the fileOrURLParameter by hand.
