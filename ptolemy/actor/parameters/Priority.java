/**
 A parameter to store an integer number priority in an actor. The default
 priority is 0. A smaller number designates a higher priority. In an execution
 with a timed model of computation, such as DE, when two actors are scheduled
 with the same timestamp and microstep, they are fired according to the priority
 specified for them. The actor with a smaller priority number is fired before
 the one with a greater priority number.
