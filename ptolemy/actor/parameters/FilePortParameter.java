//// FilePortParameter

/**
 This file parameter creates an associated port that can be used to update
 the current value of the parameter. The value of this
 parameter, accessed by getExpression(), is a string that names a file
 or URL, possibly containing references to variables defined in scope
 using the syntax $ID, ${ID} or $(ID). The value returned by getToken()
 is name of the file with such references resolved.
 <p>
 If the model containing this port
 parameter has been saved to a MoML file, then the file name can be
 given relative to the directory containing that MoML file.
 If the model has not been saved to a file,
 then the classpath is used for identifying relative file names.
 <p>
 Files can be given relative to a <i>base</i>, where the base is
 the URI of the first container above this one that has a URIAttribute.
 Normally, this URI specifies the file or URL containing the model
 definition. Thus, files that are referred to here can be kept in the
 same directory as the model, or in a related directory, and can
 moved together with the model.
 <p>
 The following special file names are understood:
 <ul>
 <li> System.in: Standard input.
 <li> System.out: Standard output.
 </ul>
 Note, however, that these file names cannot be converted to URLs
 using the asURL() method.
 A file name can also contain the following strings that start
 with "$", which get substituted
 with the appropriate values.
 <table>
 <tr>
 <th>String</th>
 <th>Description</th>
 <th>Property</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <tr><code>$CWD</code></tr>
 <tr>The current working directory</tr>
 <tr><code>user.dir</code></tr>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <tr><code>$HOME</code></tr>
 <tr>The user's home directory</tr>
 <tr><code>user.home</code></tr>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <tr><code>$PTII</code></tr>
 <tr>The home directory of the Ptolemy II installation</tr>
 <tr><code>ptolemy.ptII.dir</code></tr>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <tr><code>$TMPDIR</code></tr>
 <tr>The temporary directory</tr>
 <tr><code>java.io.tmpdir</code></tr>
 </tr>
 </table>
 The above properties are normally set when a Ptolemy II application starts.
 <p>
 If a file name begins with the reference "$CLASSPATH", then when
 the file is opened for reading, the openForReading() method
 will search for the file relative to the classpath (using the
 getResource() method of the current class loader).  This will only
 work for a file that exists, and thus the openForWriting() method
 will not understand the "$CLASSPATH" string; this makes sense
 since the classpath typically has several directories, and it
 would not be obvious where to create the file.  The asURL()
 method also recognizes the "$CLASSPATH" string, but not the asFile()
 method (which is typically used when accessing a file for writing).
 NOTE: If the container of this parameter also contains a variable
 named CLASSPATH, then the value of that variable is used instead
 of the Java classpath.
 <p>
 This parameter has two values,
 which may not be equal, a <i>current value</i> and a <i>persistent value</i>.
 The persistent value is returned by
 getExpression() and is set by any of three different mechanisms:
 <ul>
 <li> calling setExpression();
 <li> calling setToken(); and
 <li> specifying a value as a constructor argument.
 </ul>
 All three of these will also set the current value, which is then
 equal to the persistent value.
 The current value is returned by get getToken()
 and is set by any of three different mechanisms:
 <ul>
 <li> calling setCurrentValue();
 <li> calling update() sets the current value if there is an associated
 port, and that port has a token to consume; and
 </ul>
 These three techniques do not change the persistent value, so after
 these are used, the persistent value and current value may be different.
 <p>
 When using this parameter in an actor, care must be exercised
 to call update() exactly once per firing prior to calling getToken().
 Each time update() is called, a new token will be consumed from
 the associated port (if the port is connected and has a token).
 If this is called multiple times in an iteration, it may result in
 consuming tokens that were intended for subsequent iterations.
 Thus, for example, update() should not be called in fire() and then
 again in postfire().  Moreover, in some domains (such as DE),
 it is essential that if a token is provided on a port, that it
 is consumed.  In DE, the actor will be repeatedly fired until
 the token is consumed.  Thus, it is an error to not call update()
 once per iteration.  For an example of an actor that uses this
 mechanism, see Ramp.
 <p>
 If this actor is placed in a container that does not implement
 the TypedActor interface, then no associated port is created,
 and it functions as an ordinary file parameter.  This is useful,
 for example, if this is put in a library, where one would not
 want the associated port to appear.

 <p>There are a few situations where FilePortParameter might not do what
 you expect:

 <ol>
 <li> If it is used in a transparent composite actor, then a token provided
 to a FilePortParameter will never be read.  A transparent composite actor
 is one without a director.

 <br>Workaround: Put a director in the composite.

 <li> Certain actors read parameter
 values only during initialization.  During initialization, a
 FilePortParameter can only have a value set via the parameter (it
 can't have yet received a token).  So if the initial value
 is set to the value of the FilePortParameter, then it will
 see only the parameter value, never the value provided via the
 port.

 <br>Workaround: Use a RunCompositeActor to contain the model.
