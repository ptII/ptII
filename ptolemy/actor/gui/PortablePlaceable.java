/**
 * This interface is analogous to the {@link Placeable} interface.  However, this
 * interface is platform independent, and it's expected that implementers of the
 * interface are also platform independent.  By platform independent, we mean there is
 * no dependendency to java.awt or java.swing packages.
 *
 * <p>Interface for objects that have UI components that can be placed in containers.
 * These objects can be fairly tricky to write because of the fact that they
 * might be placed in a control panel, or be expected to create their own
 * container.  Moreover, from one run to the next, this situation might change.
 * That is, it might create a container on one run, but on the next run, place
 * the display in specified container (like a control panel).
 * Objects that implement this interface should pass the following tests:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Run the model from the toolbar. The object creates a container.</li>
 * <li>Close the container during the run. The run continues without the container.</li>
 * <li>Move and resize the container during the run.</li>
 * <li>Save the model and close it. Then open and re-run.
 * Placement and size is preserved.</li>
 * <li>Re-run the model from the toolbar. Move and resize is preserved.</li>
 * <li>Run the model from the View:Run menu. If a frame is visible, it first
 * gets closed.</li>
 * <li>Close the run control panel and run from the toolbar. A frame is opened,
 * using the last size and placement.
 * <li>Delete the actor. Frame should close, or display in the control
 * panel should disappear.</li>
 * </ol>
