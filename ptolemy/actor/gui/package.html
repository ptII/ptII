Ptolemy GUI components for actors and configurations.

<p>This package consists of several types of classes:
<ol>
  <li>Classes that manage the editors
  <li>Graphical User Interface (GUI) classes that render
      specific editors.
  <li>Classes that invoke models
</ol>

<h2>Classes that manage editors</h2>

A ptolemy application has a configuration which is a xml file found in
$PTII/ptolemy/configs.  For example, the "Full" configuration is found
in $PTII/ptolemy/configs/full/configuration.xml.

<p>The configuration.xml file defines a set of properties and entities
that determine what editors are available to view a model.

<p>It is possible to invoke Ptolemy models without using the
configuration system, see {@link ptolemy.moml.MoMlSimpleApplication}.

<p>The {@link ptolemy.actor.gui.Configuration} class is in charge of
the user interface, it coordinates views of multiple models.  The
Configuration class manages the opening of new models by ensuring
that the appropriate viewer is used.

<p>The Configuration class contains a {@link
ptolemy.actor.gui.ModelDirectory}, which is a directory of open
models.  Each open model is represented by an instance of an
{@link ptolemy.actor.gui.Effigy}.

<p>An Effigy represents model metadata, such as the location from
which the model originated, whether the model has been modified.
See {@link ptolemy.actor.gui.Effigy} for a discussion about
why the class is called "Effigy".

<p>Each open model has an Effigy.  The Effigy contains a
{@link ptolemy.actor.gui.Tableau} that is a visual representation
of the model in a top-level window.  The Tableau contains
a javax.swing.JFrame, which may be accessed via
{@link ptolemy.actor.gui.Tableau#getFrame()}.

<h2>How a file is opened using the Configuration class</h2>
The {@link ptolemy.actor.gui.ConfigurationApplication} uses
the {@link ptolemy.actor.gui.Configuration} class to open a
model.
ConfigurationApplication uses these steps
<ol>
  <li>Set up {@link ptolemy.moml.MoMLFilter}s.
  <li>Parse arguments, look for a configuration file and parse
  the configuration file.
  <li>For each model, parse the xml and then open each
  model with:
  {@link ptolemy.actor.gui.Configuration#openModel(NamedObj)}.
  <li>openModel() checks with the ModelDirectory to see
  if the model is already open.  If the model is open, then
  the Tableau that contains a reference to the JFrame is returned.
  <li>If openModel() does not find an open model, then we
  look for a EffigyFactory and then ask the EffigyFactory to
  create an Effigy for our model.
  <li>The EffigyFactory loops through its contained factories
  and calls {@link
  ptolemy.actor.gui.EffigyFactory#createEffigy(CompositeEntity, URL,
  URL)} for each factory.
  <li>The createEffigy() method determines if it should create
  an Effigy for the container and urls.  If createEffigy() 
  for a particular viewer does not want to create an Effigy for
  a particular model, then it returns null and then next factory
  gets to try.  Eventually, a createEffigy() method is found
  that creates an Effigy, or an error is thrown.
  <li>Once Configuration.openModel() gets an effigy, then
  {@link ptolemy.actor.gui.Configuration#createPrimaryTableau(Effigy)}
  is called, which returns a Tableau.  The Tableau contains
  a reference to the javax.swing.JFrame that is a view on the model.
</ol>  
  


<h2>Graphical User Interface (GUI) classes that render
      specific editors.</h2>
  In general, each view on a model has a corresponding Effigy and
  Tableau class.  Some viewers also have Viewer and/or Frame classes.
