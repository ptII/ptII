/**
 This is an intermediate container tableau factory that is designed to contain
 all tableau factories in a configuration that are capable of displaying a
 Ptolemy II model.  This class sets up the effigy with a set of available
 views.  Tableaux can use that to set up a View menu which offers alternative
 views besides the default view. Subclasses of this class will usually
 be inner classes of a Tableau, and will create the Tableau.
