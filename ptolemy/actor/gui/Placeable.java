/**
 Interface for objects that have UI components that can be placed in containers.
 These objects can be fairly tricky to write because of the fact that they
 might be placed in a control panel, or be expected to create their own
 frame.  Moreover, from one run to the next, this situation might change.
 That is, it might create a frame on one run, but on the next run, place
 the display in specified frame (like a control panel).
 Objects that implement this interface should pass the following tests:
 <ol>
 <li>Run the model from the toolbar. The object creates a frame.</li>
 <li>Close the frame during the run. The run continues without the display.</li>
 <li>Move and resize the frame during the run.</li>
 <li>Save the model and close it. Then open and re-run.
 Placement and size is preserved.</li>
 <li>Re-run the model from the toolbar. Move and resize is preserved.</li>
 <li>Run the model from the View:Run menu. If a frame is visible, it first
 gets closed.</li>
 <li>Close the run control panel and run from the toolbar. A frame is opened,
 using the last size and placement.
 <li>Delete the actor. Frame should close, or display in the control
 panel should disappear.</li>
 </ol>
