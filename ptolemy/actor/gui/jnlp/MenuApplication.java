//// MenuApplication

/** A wrapper that starts up Vergil from a menu.

 <p>MenuApplication is primarily for use with the
 Java Network Launching Protocol
 (JNLP) aka Web Start, but it can be used with any system that invokes
 applications via a menu choice such as the InstallAnywhere lax tool.

 <p>If MenuApplication detects that it was invoked from a menu, then
 it sets the current directory to the value of user's home directory
 so that when the user opens a file chooser to safe a file then
 the initial default directory is the user's home directory
 instead of the application directory

 <p>The security manager is set to null for two reasons:
 <ol>
 <li> Get rid of the following message when we open the file browser:
 <br> "There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into drive A"
 with the standard Abort/Retry/Ignore buttons.
 See:
 <a href="http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jsp?forum=38&thread=71610">http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jsp?forum=38&thread=71610</a>

 <li> Speed things up, see
 <a href="http://forums.java.sun.com/thread.jsp?forum=38&thread=134393">http://forums.java.sun.com/thread.jsp?forum=38&thread=134393</a>
 </ol>


 <p>Note that in Web Start 1.0.1, it is necessary to sign the application
 if it is to have access to the local disk etc.  The way that this is
 handled is that the .jnlp file that defines the application
 is copied to the .jar file that defines the main() method for
 the application and the .jar file is signed.  Unfortunately, this means
 that two Web Start applications cannot share one jar file, so
 we create wrappers that call the appropriate main method.

 <p>For more information about JNLP, see $PTII/mk/jnlp.in.

 <p>Each JNLP Application should extend MenuApplication and simply
 have its main() call this main().  The makefile will need
 to be extended to create a jar file that includes
 <pre>
 MenuApplication.class
 <i>Foo</i>Application.class
 </pre>
