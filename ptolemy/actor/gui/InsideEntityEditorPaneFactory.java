/**
 This is an attribute that can create a pane (called a "configuration
 widget") for interactively configuring an entity contained by its container.
 That is, it adds a level of indirection, making it appear as if you
 were configuring the container, when in fact you are configuring an
 entity contained by the container.  If the container is not an instance
 of CompositeEntity, or it does not contain any entities, then this behaves
 just like the base class.  If the container contains more than one entity,
 then only the first one encountered is configured.  To use this,
 place an instance of this class (or a derived class) inside a Ptolemy II
 object.  When the user double clicks on the icon for that object,
 or selects Configure from the context menu, then a dialog is opened
 containing the pane returned by createEditorPane().
