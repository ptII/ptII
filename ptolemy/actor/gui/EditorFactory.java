/**
 This is an attribute that can create an editor for interactively
 configuring its container. If you place an instance of this class
 inside a Ptolemy II object, then when a user double clicks on the
 object, instead of
 the default behavior (which is to edit parameters), the createEditor()
 method of this class is called.
 <p>
 This differs from EditorPaneFactory
 in that it is responsible for every aspect of creating the editor.
 Thus, it has to create a top-level window, rather than just a pane
 to insert in a top-level window.
 <p>
 In this base class, the createEditor() method is abstract.
 Derived classes must override this method to present a user
 interface for configuring the object.
 For example, a digital filter actor could present a filter
 design interface.  A plotter actor could present a panel for
 configuring a plot.  A file reader actor could present a file
 browser.
