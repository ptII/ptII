/**
 An application that sets the look and feel to the native look
 and feel and then reads one or more
 files specified on the command line, or instantiates one or
 more Java classes specified by the -class option.

 <p>This class sets the look and feel of the user interface (UI) to
 the native look and feel.  Thus, this class invokes Java's user
 interface code which means that this class should be run in an
 environment that has a display.  To run in a environment
 that has no display, see the {@link ptolemy.actor.gui.Configuration}
 parent class.

 <p>For complete usage, see the {@link ptolemy.actor.gui.Configuration}
 parent class.
