/**
 This attribute annotates user settable attributes to specify
 an editable combobox style for configuring the containing attribute.
 An editable combobox allows an arbitrary value to be entered in the
 combobox.
 For an uneditable combobox, use ChoiceStyle instead.
 The choices that are presented in the combobox
 are given by a set of attributes implementing the Settable interface,
 such as StringAttribute, contained by this style.
 <p>
 This class extends ChoiceStyle only for the purpose of eliminating code
 duplication.
