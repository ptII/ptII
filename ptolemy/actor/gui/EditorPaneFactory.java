//// EditorPaneFactory

/**
 This is an attribute that can create a pane (called a "configuration
 widget") for interactively configuring its container.  To use this,
 place an instance of this class (or a derived class) inside a Ptolemy II
 object.  When the user double clicks on the icon for that object,
 or selects Configure from the context menu, then a dialog is opened
 containing the pane returned by createEditorPane().
 <p>
 In this base class, the createEditorPane() method creates an
 instance of PtolemyQuery with one entry for each parameter in
 the container. This is the default mechanism
 for editing parameters.  Derived classes may override this
 method to present radically different interfaces to the user.
 For example, a digital filter actor could present a filter
 design interface.  A plotter actor could present a panel for
 configuring a plot.  A file reader actor could present a file
 browser.
