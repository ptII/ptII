/**
 A tableau representing an external text editor (for now emacs only, with
 the gnuserv package installed).<p>

 This is just a demo form. TextEditorTableau should really be made
 abstract and have different implementations depending on user
 preferences. ExternalTextTableau should not really derive from the java
 swing Frame based TextEditorTableau. The interface of the abstract
 TextEditorTableau should support both swing JFrame based editor and
 external text editor classes.

 Note that one could send signals (events) back to this class for
 example if the buffer associated with this "tableau" is deleted or
 updated or "Saved As". This could be achieved by adding special "hooks"
 to emacs' file operation hook lists...
