//// LazyTypedCompositeActor

/**
 An aggregation of typed actors with lazy evaluation. The contents of
 this actor can be created in the usual way via visual editor by dragging
 in other actors and ports and connecting them. When it exports a MoML
 description of itself, it describes its ports and parameters in the
 usual way, but contained actors, relations, and their interconnections
 are exported within &lt;configure&gt; &lt;/configure&gt; tags.
 When reloading the MoML description, evaluation of the MoML
 within the configure tags is deferred until there is an explicit
 request for the contents. This behavior is useful for large
 complicated models where the time it takes to instantiate the
 entire model is large. It permits opening and browsing the model
 without a long wait. However, the cost comes typically when
 running the model. The instantiation time will be added to
 the time it takes to preinitialize the model.
<p>
 The lazy contents of this composite are specified via the configure()
 method, which is called by the MoML parser and passed MoML code.
 The MoML is evaluated lazily; i.e. it is not actually evaluated
 until there is a request for its contents, via a call to
 getEntity(), numEntities(), entityList(), relationList(),
 or any related method. You can also force evaluation
 of the MoML by calling populate(). Accessing the attributes
 or ports of this composite does not trigger a populate() call,
 so a visual editor can interact with the actor from the outside
 in the usual way, enabling connections to its ports, editing
 of its parameters, and rendering of its custom icon, if any.
 <p>
 The configure method can be passed a URL or MoML text or both.
 If it is given MoML text, that text will normally be wrapped in a
 processing instruction, as follows:
 <pre>
 &lt;?moml
 <group>
 ... <i>MoML elements giving library contents</i> ...
 </group>
 ?&gt;
 </pre>
 The processing instruction, which is enclosed in "&lt;?" and "?&gt"
 prevents premature evaluation of the MoML.  The processing instruction
 has a <i>target</i>, "moml", which specifies that it contains MoML code.
 The keyword "moml" in the processing instruction must
 be exactly as above, or the entire processing instruction will
 be ignored.  The populate() method
 strips off the processing instruction and evaluates the MoML elements.
 The group element allows the library contents to be given as a set
 of elements (the MoML parser requires that there always be a single
 top-level element, which in this case will be the group element).
 <p>
 One subtlety in using this class arises because of a problem typical
 of lazy evaluation.  A number of exceptions may be thrown because of
 errors in the MoML code when the MoML code is evaluated.  However,
 since that code is evaluated lazily, it is evaluated in a context
 where these exceptions are not expected.  There is no completely
 clean solution to this problem; our solution is to translate all
 exceptions to runtime exceptions in the populate() method.
 This method, therefore, violates the condition for using runtime
 exceptions in that the condition that causes these exceptions to
 be thrown is not a testable precondition.
 <p>
 A second subtlety involves cloning.  When this class is cloned,
 if the configure MoML text has not yet been evaluated, then the clone
 is created with the same (unevaluated) MoML text, rather than being
 populated with the contents specified by that text.  If the object
 is cloned after being populated, the clone will also be populated.
 Cloning is used in actor-oriented classes to create subclasses
 or instances of a class.  When a LazyTypedCompositeActor contained
 by a subclass or an instance is populated, it delegates to the
 instance in the class definition. When that instance is populated,
 all of the derived instances in subclasses and instances of the
 class will also be populated as a side effect.
  <p>
 A third subtlety is that parameters of this actor cannot refer to
 contained entities or relations, nor to attributes contained by
 those. This is a rather esoteric use of expressions, so
 this limitation may not be onerous. You probably didn't know
 you could do that anyway.  An attempt to make such references
 will simply result in the expression failing to evaluate.

 <p>
