For example, the BCVTB allows to simulate a building and HVAC system in EnergyPlus and the control logic in MATLAB/Simulink, while exchanging data between the software as they simulate. The BCVTB is based on the <a class="http" href="http://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/index.htm#in_browser">Ptolemy II</a> software environment. The BCVTB is still under development and aimed at expert users of simulation. Due to the different programs that may be involved in distributed simulation, familiarity with compiling and configuring programs is essential. <span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span></p><p class="line874">Programs that are linked to the BCVTB are  <span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span></p><ul><li><p class="line891"><a class="http" href="http://www.energyplus.gov#in_browser">EnergyPlus</a>,  <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span></p></li><li><p class="line891"><a class="http" href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab#in_browser">MATLAB</a>,  <span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span></p></li><li><p class="line891"><a class="http" href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink/#in_browser">Simulink</a> and  <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span></p></li><li><p class="line891"><a class="http" href="http://www.dynasim.se#in_browser">Dymola</a>, which is a <a class="http" href="http://www.modelica.org#in_browser">Modelica</a> modeling and simulation environment.  <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span></p></li></ul><p class="line862">In future work we will link a <a class="http" href="http://www.bacnet.org/#in_browser">BACnet</a> compliant Building Automation System (BAS) and digital/analog converters to the BCVTB. In addition to using programs that are coupled to Ptolemy II, Ptolemy II's graphical modeling environment can also be used to define models for control systems, for physical devices, for communication systems or for post-processing and real-time visualization. <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span></p><p class="line874">Typical applications of the BCVTB include: <span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span></p><ul><li>performance assessment of integrated building energy and controls systems, <span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span></li><li>development of new controls algorithms, and <span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span></li><li>formal verification of controls algorithms prior to deployment in a building in order to reduce commissioning time. <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span></li></ul><p class="line862">The coupling of Modelica allows using EnergyPlus for modeling the building heat flow and daylight availability and using Modelica to model innovative building energy and control systems based on the library that is currently in development at <a class="https" href="https://gaia.lbl.gov/bir#in_browser">https://gaia.lbl.gov/bir</a>.

This will allow testing supervisory control sequences using an EnergyPlus model to assess the energy and comfort performance of different supervisory control algorithms. It will also allow formal verification of control sequences before deployment to a building. <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span></p><p class="line867">
