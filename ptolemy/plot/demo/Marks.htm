<h1>Plot data read from a URL</h1>

The plot below obtains its data from a
<a href="plotmlSample.txt">data file</a> at a URL.
The file format is PlotML, based on the popular internet language XML,
<i>extensible markup language</i>.

<p>
This plot shows certain features of the plotter. Note that color is
disabled, and individual marks are used for the first ten data sets.
After that, the marks are recycled, so the eleventh data set is
indistinguishable from the first. (Had we used color, we would be able
to distinguish up to 110 distinct datasets). Also note that the first two
data sets are connected with lines, but the remaining data sets are
not. The ranges for the horizontal and vertical axes are computed
automatically from the data, but the tick marks for the horizontal axis
are specified explicitly in the PlotML file. This is why they appear as
words rather than numbers. Note further that each axis and each data
set is labeled by a string given in the PlotML file. For details about
the PlotML file format, see the
<a href="../doc/plot.pdf" target="_top">Plot Chapter</a>.

<p>Note that because of a bug in Java 1.4.0_01, this applet may fail
if it is being viewed on a local file system, see
<a href="../doc/troubleshooting.htm#spaces">AccessControlException caused by spaces in path name</a></h2> for details.
