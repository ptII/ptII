surrounding plotting only one stem.
</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot5.5 and ptplot5.6</H2>
<menu>
<li>Christopher Brooks: pxgraph now takes a "-" argument, which
indicates that data should be read from standard input.
</menu>

the method inside the Swing Event thread.
<li>Christopher Brooks: PlotFrame, PlotApplication,
EditablePlotMLApplication: Get colors of menus right.
<li>Ted Nolan: EPSGraphics: if a legend has parens in it, then
it causes EPS syntax errors.
<li>Christopher Brooks: Plot: Handle cases where we have only one
point in a dataset.
<li>Andreas Traupe: Added new method PlotBox.renameLegend().
Plot._clear should clear() the Vector not create a new one.
</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot5.3 and ptplot5.4</H2>
<menu>
<li>Christopher Hylands Brooks: PlotFrame: 
handle errors when opening and closing streams
<li> Steven Nuendorffer: Plot: Avoid drawing points and lines that are not
visible.
</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot5.2 and ptplot5.3</H2>
<menu>
<li> Roger Robins: PlotApplet: Work around problem in Java 1.3.1_08
where if we create 6 instances of a Plot applet then navigate forward
then back - IE and Navigator hang.
<li>Christopher Hylands: reuseDatasets in a PlotML file was 
being ignored. Added PlotBox.getLegendDataset(),
Plot.getReuseDatasets().  Plot.addLegend() and PlotMLParser.startElement()
now check the value of reuseDatasets and acts accordingly.
(bug reported by Balazs Mezodi)
<li>Peter N. Steinmetz: Added getXAutoRange(), getYAutoRange(),
getColors(), setColors(), getPlotRectangle(), setPlotRectangle()
setPlotRectangle():
"... allow[s] user specification of the rectangle 
nside the axes, the 'plot rectangle' of the PlotBox class. I am 
using this to line up two graphs which share the same time scale. "
<li> Edward A. Lee: Use a thicker stroke when drawing lines.
<li> Steve Neuendorffer: Improvements for offscreen buffer support
so that Ptplot can plot data sets with 20000 points.
<li> Peter N. Steinmetz: If PlotApplication is called with a "-"
option, then it reads from standard input.
<li> Helge Weissig:
Moved checks for <CODE>original<I>{X,Y}</I>RangeGiven</CODE> from
<CODE> set<I>{X,Y}</I>Range()</CODE> to
<CODE>_set<I>{X,Y}</I>Range()</CODE> so that if we have a simple plot
consisting only of data, then Reset Axes works properly.

<li> Peter Carr: EditablePlot.java: getData() and _setData()
incorrectly were using _dataset instead of dataset.

</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot5.1p3 and ptplot5.2</H2>
<menu>
<li> Edward A. Lee, Alberto Gobbi:  Renamed _deferIfNecessary()
to deferIfNecessary() and made it public.  Added note about 
using deferIfNecessary() to the Plot class comment that
describes how to handle modifying the plot from a separate thread.
<li> David French: added removeLegend()
<li> John Olmstead, Edward A. Lee: rotate Y axis label

<li> Christopher Hylands: Use .plt and .xml as default extensions when
opening or saving as, use plot.xml as a default name

<li> Roger Schwenke, Christopher Hylands: Add better documentation
about how to use Log axes.
<li> Alberto Gobbi, Christopher Hylands:
Fix for &lt;dataset name= ... connected=...&gt; to PlotMLParser.java

</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot5.1p2 and ptplot5.1p3</H2>

<li> Laurent Etur: Scale the printout to fit the page
</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot5.1p1 and ptplot5.1p2</H2>
<menu>

<li> Rob Kroeger: 4 new  PlotBox.exportImage() methods
that create a BufferedImage to display the plot in.  This
method can be used to plot data and write out images for
use in servlets.
PlotBox._drawPlot and Plot._drawPlot() now take a Rectangle argument
to support this.

<li> Ross Beyer: When we print, ask the user for the page format.

<li> Paul H. Buckle:
In class ptolemy.plot.Plot._fillPlot() the instances of -Double.MIN_VALUE
should be -Double.MAX_VALUE

<li> Paul H. Buckle:
In ptolemy.plot.PlotBox.clear(boolean) should clear flags for
_originalYRangeGiven and _originalYRangeGiven

Netscape4.6 because of plugin issues.
</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot2.2 and ptplot3.1</H2>
<menu>

  right mouse button to edit the dataset).

<li> Editable format (invoke ptplot, and try Edit:Format).

<li> PlotML file format.

<li> Moved pxgraph classes into compat subdirectory

<li> Added Histogram classes in <CODE>plotml</CODE> package

<H2>The changes between ptplot2.1 and ptplot2.2</H2>
<menu>
<li> Added <a href="../EPSGraphics.java"><CODE>EPSGraphics.java</CODE></a>
which will generate Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) on stdout.
See the class comment for a description of where stdout goes
on the various browsers.

<li> PlotBox now has the following keybindings:
<ul>
<li> Cntrl-c: Export the plot to the clipboard.

	Porter Mason &lt;pmason@NRAO.EDU&gt;
        in <CODE>reusedatasets: on</CODE>
  </ul>

</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot2.0 and ptplot2.1</H2>
<menu>
<li> Added <a href="../Histogram.java"><CODE>Histogram.java</CODE></a>,
<a href="../HistogramApplet.java"><CODE>HistogramApplet.java</CODE></a>,
and
<a href="../demo/Histogram.htm"><CODE>../demo/Histogram.java</CODE></a>.

<li> Moved index.htm out of the top level, and set up files to use frames.
<li> Modified top level makefile to use InstallShield's JShield
to build releases.
<li> Added <a href="download"><code>doc/download</code></a>
directory which provides links to multiple download formats

<li> Plot.java:
Use <CODE>"\t"</CODE> instead of an actual tab so as to avoid problems
with reindentation.
Reported by Louis Hernandez, Jr. &lt;lhernan@sandia.gov&gt;

<li> Added <a href="thirdparty.htm">Third Party uses of Ptplot</a>
web page

<li> Ptplot2.1 was released as part of
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII">Ptolemy II 0.2</a>

</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot2.0a2 and ptplot2.0</H2>
<menu>
<li> Added <a href="thirdparty.htm">Third Party uses of Ptplot</a>
web page
</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot2.0a2 and ptplot2.0</H2>
<menu>
<li> configure now chooses between <CODE>-depend</CODE> and <CODE>-Xdepend</CODE>.
</menu>


<H2>The changes between ptplot2.0a1 and ptplot2.0a2</H2>
<menu>
<li> Changed image on index.htm
<li> Modified help and about content
<li> Modified Message constructors
<li> No longer ship LogicAnalyzer, it is not ready
</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot1.3p1 and ptplot2.0a1</H2>
<menu>
<li> The major change is that the classes were moved from
the <CODE>ptplot</CODE> package to the <CODE>ptolemy.plot</CODE> package.

<li> The <CODE>ptplotapplet.jar</CODE> file has been renamed to
<CODE>ptolemy.plotapplet.jar</CODE> to better reflect the package structure.

<li> <CODE>PlotApplication.java</CODE> was moved to a new directory
called <CODE>ptolemy/apps</CODE>.


<li> The <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> script has been removed.  A new
script <CODE>ptplot</CODE> replaces it.  Usually, <CODE>ptplot</CODE> uses
the PlotApplication class.
If <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> is a link to <CODE>ptplot</CODE>, then when
<CODE>pxgraph</CODE> is run, it uses the Pxgraph class


<li> Removed <CODE>ptplot2mif.tcl</CODE>, it was of little use.


<h3>PlotBox</h3>
<menu>

<li> Changed zoom out so it is not limited to the fill region.
You can now zoom out arbitrarily far.


<li> Fixed a bug where YTicks was not recognized in a file (XTicks was).


<li> Fixed a bug where DataSet: with a blank name does not create a blank
legend entry.


<li> Use jdk 1.1 event model everywhere.
   <br>action() method is gone
   <br>mouseDown() method is gone
   <br>mouseDrag() method is gone
   <br>mouseUp() method is gone

<li> Use jdk 1.1 font support.
   <br>getFontByName() method is gone

<li> Use jdk 1.1 method names where they are different from jdk 1.0:
   <br>setSize() replaces resize()

<li> The following methods are now deprecated:
   <br>init() (use addFillButton and read())
   <br>parseFile() (use read() -- NOTE: no longer reads pxgraph binary files).
   <br>setBinary() (use readPxgraph() in the Plot class).
   <br>setDataurl() (use read())
   <br>setDocumentBase() (use read())
   <br>_setButtonsVisibility() (use a menu rather than buttons in applications)

<li> The following methods are new:
   <br>makeButtons()
   <br>read()
   <br>readBinary()
   <br>zoom()

<li> The following methods are gone:
   <br>minimumSize()
   <br>preferredSize()
   <br>reshape() (replaced by setBounds() for jdk 1.1).
   <br>_parseBinaryData()

<li> The following members are gone:
   <br>_graphics (protected).  Use getGraphics() instead.

<li> The following method has been made protected (was public):
   <br>_drawPlot() (was drawPlot())


<li> The following class is gone:
   <br>PlotDataException (use IOException, which offers identical features).

<li> Used javadoc formatting throughout.

</menu>

<h3>Plot</h3>

Same changes as above, plus...

<menu>

<li> Fixed bug where auto-ranging depended on all data seen historically.
     Now it is recalculated if boundary points are erased.

<li> New method:
   <br>clear()
   <br>readPxgraph() (reads a binary stream)

<li> Deprecated:
   <br>setNumSets() (no longer needed -- sets are added as they are mentioned).
   <br>getMaxDataSets() (irrelevant now)
</menu>

<h3>PlotApplet</h3>
<menu>
<li> No longer implements runnable (the run method just called repaint(),
which seems pointless).  No longer creates a thread.

<li> Removed:
   <br>run()
   <br>start()
   <br>stop()

<li> In the init() method, PlotApplet no longer calls plot().init(),
which is deprecated.
This is the only change that is not backwards compatible.
It means that applets derived from PlotApplet need to replace the
call to init().
</menu>

<h3>PlotLive</h3>
 <p>I was unable to keep this class completely backwards compatible.
So PlotLiveDemo and PlotLiveDemoApplet both had to be modified for
things to work again.

 <p>Also I removed the debug printing lines everywhere.
I found that they produced a huge amount of clutter, making it hard
to read the code.  And they generated so much info that they were hard
to use anyway.  And they were creeping into user-level code
(PlotLiveDemo and PlotLiveDemoApplet).

<h3>PlotLiveApplet</h3>
New class to handle the thread trickiness for live plots.

<h3>CmdLineArgException</h3>
This class is now public so that it can be used outside of the plot
package.

<h3>New classes</h3>
<dl>

<dt> <a href="../PlotFrame.java">PlotFrame</a>
<dd> 2-D plotter widget used by PlotApplication, below.


<dt> <a href="../PlotApplication.java">PlotApplication</a>
<dd> Stand alone plotter application, started up by
<CODE>ptplot</CODE></a>

<dt> <a href="../demo/TwoPlotExample.java">TwoPlotExample</a>
<dd> a simple example application with two side by side plots.

</dl>
</menu>


<H2>The changes between ptplot1.3 and ptplot1.3p1</H2>
<menu>

<li> The plotting region is now always white.  Formerly, the <CODE>-bg</CODE>
option would change the color of the plotting region and the region
around the plotting region where the legend is.  Now <CODE>-bg</CODE>
only changed the region around the plotting region.  The reason for
this change is that the colors of the data sets were designed to be
used on a white background.

<li> Ignore the <CODE>-bb</CODE> command line argument.  In the X11
version of <CODE>pxgraph</CODE>, <CODE>-bb</CODE> drew a bounding box
around the data region. Formerly, the Java version printed a message about
<CODE>-bb</CODE> not being supported.  In the Java version of
<CODE>pxgraph</CODE>, the region where plots appear is a different
color than the surround region, which makes <CODE>-bb</CODE> useless.

<li> Various minor cleanups to the comments.  Stripped out trailing spaces at
the end of lines.

<li> Added <CODE>fillPlot()</CODE> method back in so that client
programs can call it.  Reported by Stephan Puchegger &lt;a9127383@unet.univie.ac.at&gt;
<li> If <CODE>JAVAHOME</CODE> is not set, and <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> cannot
find a JDK, then it looks in <CODE>/usr/eesww/lang/jdk1.1latest</CODE>.
This is for use in the EECS Department here at UC Berkeley.
</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot1.2p1 and ptplot1.3</H2>
<menu>
<li> <CODE>pxgraph =500x500-0-0</CODE> was throwing
a numeric exception.
<li> Added <CODE>ReuseDataSets: on</CODE> file directive, which
causes datasets with the same name to be merged into one dataset
when plotted.  This is useful for combining multiple files
that plot the same datasets.
<li> Fixed compatibility problem with X11 version of pxgraph.
The old version of pxgraph allowed blank lines to denote the
start of a new dataset.  The problem is that we want to ignore
blank lines in the new format, but still provide compatibility
with the old behaviour.  The fix was to assume that the file
is an old format file until we see a new style directive.
<li> Fixed a bug that was plotting extraneous points before all
the data was read in from a file.
<li> The Pxgraph class and the <code>pxgraph</code>script now take
two new command line arguments:
<dl>
<dt> <CODE>-bigendian</CODE>
<dd> Data files are in big-endian, or network binary format.
If you are on a little-endian machine, such as a machine
with an Intel x86 chip, and you would like to read a binary
format file, created on a big-endian machine, such as a Sun SPARC,
use the <code>-bigendian</code> flag.

<dt><a name="-littleendian"><code>-littleendian</code></a>
<dt>Data files are in little-endian, or x86 binary format.
If you are on a big-endian machine, such as a Sun Sparc,
and you would like to read a binary
format file created on a little-endian machine, such as Intel x86
machine, then use the <code>-littleendian</code> flag.
<dd>

</dl>
<CODE>-binary</CODE> now reads pxgraph style binary data in the format
native to the machine where the Java Ptplot process is running.
The other binary format read by the <CODE>-binary</CODE> option,
known as the raw binary format is always reads data as big-endian.
The <a href="../demo/Endian.htm">Endian Examples</a> page
illustrates use of the three options.

<li> The Pxgraph class and the <code>pxgraph</code>script now take
two new command line arguments:
<DL>
<dt><code>-o</code> <code><i>output filename</i></code>
<dd>The name of the file to place the print output in.  Currently
defaults to <code>/tmp/t.ps</code>.
<dt><code>-print</code>
<dd>Bring up the print dialog immediately upon startup.  Unfortunately,
there is no way to automatically print in JDK1.1, the user must hit
the <code>Ok</code> button.
</DL>
The new command line arguments are used to make it easier to create
PostScript output.

<li> <code>ptplot2mif.tcl</code> script
can be used to convert the PostScript output of Ptplot to Framemaker
MIF format.  This script requires Tcl, and probably won't work under
Windows.  This script does not do a perfect job converting, but it is
a start.

<li> URLS with <code>&amp;</code> characters in them were being parsed
incorrectly.
 <br> This bug was reported by Marion Schroeder &lt;schroeder@hmi.de&gt;.

<li> A new jar file called <code>ptplotapplet.jar</code> is now
created.  This jar file is similar to <code>ptplot.jar</code>,
except it does not include the classes used by the Pxgraph class.
As a result, <code>ptplotapplet.jar</code> is smaller than
<code>ptplot.jar</code>.  The Pxgraph and Message classes are not
used in applets, so there is no need to download them for
applet only usage.

<li> The <CODE>_graphics</CODE> field in PlotBox is now
<CODE>transient</CODE> so that PlotBox can be serialized.
 <br> This bug was reported by
Patrick Barrett &lt;barrettp@clipper.mdcorp.ksc.nasa.gov&gt;.
</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot1.2 and ptplot1.2p1</H2>
Ptplot1.2p1 is a bug fix release.
<menu>
<li> Ptplot1.1 was able able to parse scientific notation numbers such
as <code>1.0E-12</code>, but Ptplot1.2 could not.
The change that caused the bug was that in Ptplot1.2, we used
<code>java.io.StreamTokenizer</code> to parse the
numbers.  Unfortunately, StreamTokenizer is buggy, it fails to parse
scientific notation.  For more information, see
<A href="http://developer.javasoft.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4079180.htm"><code>http://developer.javasoft.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4079180.htm</code></A>.
The fix was to adapt the Ptplot1.1 number parsing code to handle error bars.
 <br>
This bug was reported by Marion Schroeder &lt;schroeder@hmi.de&gt;.
</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot1.1 and ptplot1.2</H2>
<menu>
<li> Added support for JAR files.

<li> Added <A href="troubleshooting.htm">Troubleshooting Ptplot</A>
and <A href="ptplotfaq.htm">Ptplot FAQ</A>.


<li> Added a demo that illustrates a
JavaScript Interface to Ptplot

<li> If <code>setXRange()</code> or <code>setYRange()</code> are not
explicitly called by the user, then the data is padded slightly so that
the data is not plotted on the axes.  The
<A href="../demo/Marks.htm">Black and white plot using unique marks</A>
demo is padded.  Many of the other demos are not padded because the X
and Y ranges are explicitly set either in the data file or in the Java
code that created the plot.


<li> Raw binary files that consist only of 4 byte floats are now supported.
Formerly, ptplot only supported Joe Buck's binary format, which used
single characters as plot directives (see the
<A href="../../../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/plot/compat/PxgraphParser.html#-binary flag">javadoc Pxgraph documentation</A>
for details about this format).  The new raw binary format
now reads the first byte, and if it is not a <code>d</code>, then
the raw 4 byte float format is assumed.
 <P>This format was prompted by a request from
John O'Sullivan&lt;John.OSullivan@analog.com&gt;.
The <code>demo/data/bin.plt</code> was converted to the new raw 4 byte float
format.

<li> Error bars are now generated.  If the data file contains a line that
consists of four numbers, then the first two numbers are assumed to be the
x and y values, and the last two numbers are assumed to be the lower and upper
y values for the error bar.  The numbers can be separated by white space
or a comma.  See the <A href="../demo/ErrorBars.htm">Error Bars</A> demo
for more information.
 <br>The error bar code is based on a code fragment from
Michael Altmann &lt;michael@email.labmed.umn.edu&gt;.

<li> Ptplot now supports logarithmic axes, which are
controlled by the file directives: <code>XLog: on</code> and
<code>YLog: on</code>.  The <code>pxgraph</code> script
now takes <code>-lnx</code> and <code>-lny</code> arguments as well.
See the <A href="../demo/LogAxes.htm">Log Axes</A> demo for more information.

<li> Fixed problem with recycling colors and marks.
The bug was reported by Lutz Harnisch, &lt;Lutz.Harnisch@hmrag.com&gt;

</menu>

<H2>The changes between ptplot1.0 and ptplot1.1</H2>
<menu>
<li> In 1.1, PlotBox extends Panel.  In 1.0 PlotBox extended Applet.
This makes it much easier to use Plot as an component in either an
application or an applet that contains other components.
<li> The PlotApplet class is new in 1.1.  PlotApplet can be used
for applets that use the Plot class, or the PlotLive class.
As a result, the html applet tags for the demos now use
<code>code="ptplot.PlotApplet"</code>.
Formerly, they used
<code>code="ptplot.Plot"</code>
<li> The directory structure has been reorganized so that
the plot classes are in ptplot, and the demo classes are in
<A href="../demo/toc.htm" target="toc"><code>ptplot/demo</code></A>.
This means that the ptplot.zip does not contain the demo
classes, which is better if anyone actually wants to _use_ the plotter
instead of just running the demos.
<li> There is a Playing Wave Applet that uses real time audio.
<I>Note, this demo was removed, see
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/old/ptplot1.3/ptplot/demo/audio/PlayingWave.htm"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/old/ptplot1.3/ptplot/demo/audio/PlayingWave.htm</CODE></a>
</I>
<li> Edward Lee fixed a bar graph label bug reported by Marc Ellis.
<li> A few other minor bugs were fixed.
