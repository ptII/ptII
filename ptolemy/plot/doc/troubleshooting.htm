Below is a list of common Ptplot problems.

<h2><a name="spaces">AccessControlException caused by spaces in path name</a></h2>
Under Java 1.4.0_01, applets that have spaces in the path name may
fail if the applet tries to download a data file.  
For example, the <a href="../demo/Marks.htm">Marks demo</a> 
tries to access a data file

For example,
<code>file:///C:/tmp/ptplot/ptolemy/plot/demo/Marks.htm</code>
works fine

But doing
<pre>
cd c:/tmp
mv ptplot pt\ plot
</pre>

and then going to
<code>file:///C:/tmp/pt plot/ptolemy/plot/demo/Marks.htm</code>

results in
<pre>
java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.io.FilePermission C:\tmp\ptplot 52\ptolemy\plot\demo\plotmlSample.txt read)

This is a known bug, see:
<a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4697178">http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4697178</a>

which says:
<blockquote>
<br>CUSTOMER WORKAROUND :
<br>A couple of workarounds found:
<p>o Don't package the files into a JAR. Problem does not
appear to occur when just .class files are available.

<p>o Change directory of installed applet to one without
spaces in the name.

<p>o Access the HTML file using an HTTP URL. Problem only
occurs when file is accessed via a file URL.

<p>o Use policytool to modify the java security file, giving
permission to the file being read (was suggested by another
user here with the problem; did not confirm myself).

<p>xxxxx@xxxxx 2002-06-11
<br>This is due to the special charactor for space. When we add the permission for
the file to read, we still use "%20" instead of the real " " for the path,
which cause the applet don't have the permission to read the file.

<br>Solution: In src/share/classes/sun/applet/AppletClassLoader.java
 
call ParseUtil.decode(path) method before add the permission.
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, this bug means that if we ship a prebuilt version of ptplot
or Ptolemy II and the user tries to access the applets from the local
partition, then there will be errors.

<p>The only applets that fail are applets that are on a local file system, 
accessed with file://, that have spaces in the path and the applet
needs to access a data file that is local.

<p>This bug is not present in Java 1.3.1_03 and 1.4.1-beta.


<H2><A NAME="Problems Starting Ptplot">Problems starting ptplot or
running applets</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="CLASSPATH">Security violation</A></H3>
 <P>
One known problem is that if you have a
CLASSPATH environment set when you started your browser, you may get
an error message when accessing some of the demos.
We suggest unsetting this environment variable, restarting your
browser (and sending email to Sun's Java team to complain about the
way the CLASSPATH environment variable works).
You may also want to check the
<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/javafaq/javafaq.html">Java FAQ</a>.
<p>
If you have CLASSPATH set, and you run Netscape, then you might see
messages like:
<PRE>
Applet Marks can't start: security violation: security.class
from local disk trying to access url:
http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/ptolemy/plot/demo/data.plt
</PRE>
The
CLASSPATH variable is by far and above the trickiest thing to get right.

<H3>Script fails with: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: ptolemy/plot/plotml/EditablePlotMLApplication</H3>
Here is an example
<PRE>
bash-2.02$ ./ptplot
./ptplot: Could not find '/tmp/ptolemy/plot'.  Perhaps your PTII
 variable is not set properly?
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: ptolemy/plot/plotml/EditablePlotMLApplication
</PRE>

The problem here is that the pxgraph script cannot find the ptplot
installation.  This probably means that your PTII environment variable
is not set correctly.  Set it to point to the home directory
of the plot or Ptolemy II distribution.
 <P>
To debug such a situation completely,
use <CODE>which</CODE> (on Unix) or <code>type</code> (on Windows with Cygwin)
to find out which ptplot
script is running, and the run it with the <CODE>sh -x</CODE> flag:
First we run <CODE>which</CODE>:
<PRE>
bash-2.02$ type ptplot
ptplot is /users/cxh/ptII/bin/ptplot
</PRE>
The we use <CODE>sh -x</CODE>.  Note that the output you see might be
different, depending on what version of the <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> script
you are running.
<PRE>
bash-2.02$ sh -x /users/cxh/ptII/bin/ptplot
+ PTII_DEFAULT=/users/cxh/ptII_old
+ PTJAVA_DIR=/jdk1.2.2
+ '[' -z '' ']'
+ '[' -d /users/cxh/ptII_old ']'
+ PTII=/users/cxh/ptII_old
+ export PTII
+ '[' '!' -d /users/cxh/ptII_old/ptolemy/plot ']'
+ echo '/users/cxh/ptII/bin/ptplot: Could not find '\''/users/cxh/ptII_old/ptole
my/plot'\''.  Perhaps your PTII'
/users/cxh/ptII/bin/ptplot: Could not find '/users/cxh/ptII_old/ptolemy/plot'.
Perhaps your PTII

 variable is not set properly?

++ basename /users/cxh/ptII/bin/ptplot

+ '[' yes = yes ']'
++ cd /users/cxh/ptII_old
++ cmd /c chdir
++ tr -d '\r'
+ WINPTII=D:\users\cxh\ptII_old
+ /jdk1.2.2/bin/java -classpath 'D:\users\cxh\ptII_old;/jdk1.2.2\lib\classes.zip' ptolemy.plot.plotml.EditablePlotMLApplication
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: ptolemy/plot/plotml/E
ditablePlotMLApplication
bash-2.02$
</PRE>

In the output below, the key line is the line towards that bottom that
runs the <CODE>java</CODE> interpreter:
<PRE>
+ /jdk1.2.2/bin/java -classpath 'D:\users\cxh\ptII_old;/jdk1.2.2\lib\classes.zip' ptolemy.plot.plotml.EditablePlotMLApplication
</PRE>
In the ptplot script, the first element in the <CODE>-classpath</CODE>
argument should be a pathname that leads to the top of the Ptolemy II
or Ptplot directory tree.

<p>In this case, there are two problems, one is that <code>$PTII</code>
is not set, so the script is using the value of <code>PTII_DEFAULT</code>
which was hardwired into the script when <code>configure</code> was run.
Unfortunately, the <code>ptplot</code> script
was left over from an old installation, and at the top
of the script PTII_DEFAULT was set to <CODE>/users/cxh/ptII_old</CODE>
is an empty directory that does not contain a Ptolemy II tree.

<p> The fix is to rerun <code>configure</code>  and
<code>make install</code> so that the <code>ptplot</code> script
is properly set up.

 <P>Another common fix is to edit the <CODE>pxgraph</CODE> script
and change the variables at the top to point to the proper location.
