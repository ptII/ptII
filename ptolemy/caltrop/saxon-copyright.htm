The Saxon XSLT Processor from Michael Kay can be found at

<p> The CalInterpreter Actor requires Saxon.
<p>Saxon has the following license:

The contents of <code>$PTII/lib/saxon.jar</code> are subject to the
Mozilla Public License Version 1.0 (the "License"); you may not use
this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy

<p>Software distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS"

<p>The Original Code of Saxon comprises all those components which are
not explicitly attributed to other parties.

<p>The Initial Developer of the Original Code was Michael Kay of
International Computers Limited. Individual modules identified as
being created by other individuals include separate IPR notices. Other
contributors are acknowledged individually in comments attached to the
relevant code modules. All Rights Reserved.

<p>Since February 2001 I (Michael Kay) have been an employee of Software
AG, and I continue to develop Saxon with the support and sponsorship
of that company. Technically, therefore, the "Initial Developer" no
longer exists (the form of words was deliberately chosen to reflect
the joint involvement of myself and ICL), so I now work as a
"Contributor". International Computers Limited has since been absorbed
into Fujitsu Limited, and trades as Fujitsu Services.

<p>If you produce a product that includes or requires Saxon, please refer
to it as "The Saxon XSLT Processor from Michael Kay", and include the
URL of the home page, which is at
<a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net/#in_browser" target="_top"><code>http://saxon.sourceforge.net/</code></a>

<p>There is no guarantee of technical support, though I am usually able
to answer enquiries within a few days. Please subscribe to the mailing
list available at
<a
href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help#in_browser target="_top"><code>http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/saxon-help</code></a>

and raise any
enquiries there. Also check the Saxon project pages on sourceforge for
details of known errors; all bugs are listed there as soon as I have
sufficient evidence to describe the nature of the problem.
