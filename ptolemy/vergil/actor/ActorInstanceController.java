/**
 This class provides interaction with nodes that represent Ptolemy II
 actor instances (i.e., not classes).  This extends the base class by
 providing a mechanism in the context menu for converting the instance
 into a class.
 <p>
 NOTE: There should be only one instance of this class associated with
 a given GraphController. This is because this controller listens for
 changes to the graph and re-renders the ports of any actor instance
 in the graph when the graph changes. If there is more than one instance,
 this rendering will be done twice, which can result in bugs like port
 labels appearing twice.
