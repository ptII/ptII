//// DocApplicationSpecializer

/**
 An interface that specializes the documentation system to the application.

 <p>The docClassNameToURL() method used by {@link DocManager} and other
 classes to convert class names to URLs.  The buildCommands() method
 is used by {@link DocBuilder} to set up the build environment to
 build the documentation system if necessary.

 <p>If an application would like more control over how documentation
 is found and built, then the application can implement this interface and set
 the _docApplicationSpecializer parameter in the configuration to name
 the implementation class.
