//// BasicEdgeHighlighter

/**
 A decorator figure that displays a highlight behind an edge. This capability
 was planned for BasicHighlighter but there doesn't seem to be an easy way to
 determine that an edge is being painted. This class is a stripped down
 version of BasicHighlighter with the paint method modified so that it
 assumes that an edge is being highlighted.
