/**
 An icon that provides for the possibility that figures may be
 dynamically updated.  While some icons are generally 'static' and it
 is simplest to regenerate new figures when their attributes change,
 other icons are more 'dynamic'.  For instance, some icons might
 display live video or a live plot.  This icon provides some basic
 infrastructure for dealing with such cases.

 The main difficulty is that, by design, an icon cannot keep track of
 the figures it creates, otherwise there is a possibility for memory
 leaks or inconsistencies in the case of multiple views.  This class
 solves the problem by using a WeakReferences to keep track of
 generated figures.  These references do not prevent objects from being
 garbage collected.  This class also provides a 'safe' iterator that
 can be used to traverse the weak references without the normal
 associated nastiness.
