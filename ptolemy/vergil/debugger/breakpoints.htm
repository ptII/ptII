<h2><a name="Set Breakpoints">Set Breakpoints context menu choice</a></h2>
The context menu for actors includes a "Set Breakpoints" menu
choice.

 <p>"Set Breakpoints" is currently only implemented for the SDF
domain.  Currently, only "before iterate" and "after iterate" work.

 <p>The Set Breakpoints facility will stop the model at a specific
point in a specific actor.  This is helpful if there are multiple
instances of an actor within a model.

<ol>
<li> Start vergil from within a debugger
<li> Open an SDF model

 <br>Warning: you should save your model before running with
breakpoints set since saving in the middle of a debugging session may
not work.

<li> Right click on an actor in an SDF model, select 
Set Breakpoints -&gt; before iterate.

<li> Run the model

<li> The model will stop when it hits the breakpoint.
 <br>A message will appear in the status bar at the bottom of the
Vergil graph display. 
 <br>The actor with the breakpoint will be highlighted in magenta.


<li> Click on the Run button again to continue execution.
</ol>
