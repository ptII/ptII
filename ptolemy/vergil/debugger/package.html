Ptolemy II Debugger Interface.
<p>This package implements a debugger interface that stops
the model at specific breakpoints in specific actors.

<p> Right clicking on an actor brings up a contact menu that has "Set
Breakpoints" as a menu choice.  "Set Breakpoints" is currently only
implemented for the SDF domain.  It seems that only "before iterate"
and "after iterate" work currently.  You should be able to run the
model by clicking on the Run button.  A message will appear in the
information bar at the bottom left hand portion of the model window
when it reaches your breakpoint.  The actor with the breakpoint will
also be highlighted in magenta after the first iteration.  Click on
the Run button again to continue execution.

<p>    Some related features that you may wish to use are:
<ul>
<li> Debug -&gt; Listen to Director
<li> Right click on actor &gt; Listen to Actor
<li> Debug &gt; Animate Execution (set to something visible like 500 ms)
</ul>

    Warning: you should save your model before running with breakpoints set
    since saving in the middle of a debugging session may not work.
