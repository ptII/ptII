/**
 An implementation of a selection renderer that is used for animation.
 It highlights specified figures by wrapping them in an instance of
 a FigureDecorator. The figure decorator is obtained by
 cloning a prototype decorator, accessible through the
 get/setFigureDecorator() methods. The default prototype
 is an instance of BasicHighlighter that highlights in red.
 <p>
 This class is fashioned after BasicSelectionRenderer, but differs
 in that it ensures that selection and deselection occurs in the event
 thread. Also, it highlights objects in red rather than yellow.
