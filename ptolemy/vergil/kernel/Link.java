/**
 Instances of this class represent a link between a port and a
 relation, between two relations,
 or a between two ports.  In the first two cases,
 the relations are represented by an explicit node in the graph.  In the
 third case, there is no explicit node representing the relation and
 the edge runs directly from one port to the other.  Connections are made
 and broken by the graph model depending on
 which of the above contexts the link is being used in.
