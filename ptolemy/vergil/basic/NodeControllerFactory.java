//// NodeControllerFactory

/**
 This is an attribute that produces a custom node controller.
 This base class produces a node controller that offers only a
 configure command in the context menu, and invokes a dialog to
 edit parameters in response to that command.  It does this by
 returning an instance of IconController
 in its create() method.  Derived classes can override this
 base class to put whatever they want in the context menu,
 invoking whatever dialogs are appropriate.
 To use this class, just insert it as an attribute inside
 any Ptolemy II object, and then right clicking on the icon for
 that object will result in the use of the controller specified
 here.  The instance by convention will be named "_controllerFactory",
 but the only reason to enforce this is that only the first such
 controller factory found as an attribute will be used.
 It is a singleton, so placing it any container will replace any
 previous controller factory with the same name.
