//// PopupMouseFilter

/**
 This class is a mouseFilter that recognizes popup events.
 Unfortunately, on because of the Diva event dispatch architecture,
 it is difficult to have interactors receive mouseReleased events,
 without possibly hiding mousePressed events from other interactors.
 This class is a workaround for popup menus which uses
 MouseEvent.isPopupTrigger() for macs, but uses a hardcoded right
 mouse button for PC's.
