BUGS:
Fix layering of nodes and edges
When a graph with no graphical information is loaded, then layout should be
	triggered.
If an executed model refs other files, then those files should be relative
	to the model, not to the cwd of the editor.
In TimedSource, attributeChanged triggers a fireAt().  What happens if
	an attribute changes before fireAt can be called?
Snap off port isn't accurate.
GraphControllers should be able to report errors in a systematic way.
Cancel close of InternalFrame doesn't work under jdk1.2.2  (use jdk1.3!)
Document event is never created for "no document selected"
Ports need locations.
