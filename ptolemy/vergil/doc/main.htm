<p>
Vergil is an extensible user interface framework for component-based design
written by
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~neuendor">Steve Neuendorffer</a>,
with contributions from
Brieuc Desoutter,
Pedro Domecq,
John Reekie, and
Guillaume Vibert.
A vergil window is shown below:

This window shows a block diagram editor for Ptolemy II models.
At the upper left is a component library browser.  At the lower left
is a panner.  At the right is the block diagram editor itself.
<p>
Vergil is an extensible framework for developing component-based design
applications.  An application using Vergil, such as the block diagram
editor shown above, is configured by assembling a collection of tools
and resources in a <i>configuration</i> file, which is an XML
file.  In fact, the configuration is represented by a hierarchical
Ptolemy II model, and can be edited using Vergil.
<p>
A window in Vergil is called <i>tableau</i>.
Any number of tableau types can be combined in an application.
In the window shown above, the application includes a block diagram
editor, a finite-state machine editor, a tree view of hierarchical
models, an HTML renderer, and a simple text editor.
We expect that the number of tableaux will increase significantly
over time, offering a variety of editing and display styles.
<p>
Vergil can run as a command-line application, or as an applet.
Here is an on-line
<a href="../Vergil.htm" target="main">demo applet</a>
where you can try out some of Vergil's capabilities.
<p>
Vergil is based on <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc" target="_top">
Swing</a> and
<a href="../../../doc/ui/diva.htm">Diva</a>,
an infrastructure for structured graphics and visualization.
