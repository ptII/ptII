<DT> <A NAME="vergil description (short)"><B>1.1 What Is Vergil?</B></A>
<DD> Vergil is an extensible framework for developing component-based design applications.  Vergil can be used in applets and applications.  The
<A HREF="main.htm">top-level Vergil page</A> describes Vergil
further.

<DT> <A NAME="vergil pronunciation"><B>1.2 How do I pronounce 'vergil'?</B></A>
<DD> verge-ill.

<DT> <A NAME="virgil"><B>1.3 Isn't the guy's name 'Virgil'?</B></A>
<DD> In Latin, the author's name was Publius Vergilius Maro.  English
translations seems to be split about an accepted spelling.  If you are
interested in the author, try <a href="http://www.virgil.org" target="_top">www.virgil.org</a> for more information about him.  The name was chosen as a pseudo-acronym for
"Visual Editing Graphical Interactive Language".

<DT> <A NAME="vergil copyright"><B>1.4 What is the copyright?</B></A>
<DD> Vergil is released under the fairly liberal UC Berkeley copyright,
see <a href="../../../copyright.txt">copyright.txt</a>.
Most files have the copyright at the top.

 <p>Vergil is free for academic and commercial use.  You an incorporate it
into products, but you need to follow the instructions in the
copyright notice.

 <p>This copyright is based on the Tcl copyright that was used when
Prof. Ousterhout was developing Tcl here at UC Berkeley.  This
copyright was also used in Ptolemy Classic, which has been used in
commercial products.

<DT> <A NAME="contact"><B>1.5 How do I contact the authors?</B></A>
<DD> The primary author of Vergil is Stephen Neuendorffer.
You can contact the author at
<A HREF="mailto:neuendor@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>neuendor@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A>

<DT> <A NAME="mailing list"><B>1.6 Is there a mailing list?</B></A>
<DD> We have an internal mailing list <code>ptguidevel</code> for people
actively developing and contributing to Vergil.  There is currently no
external mailing list specifically for Vergil, however Vergil questions and
answers can be found on the regular Ptolemy
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/mailinglists.htm" target="_top">mailing lists</a>.

<!--
FIXME!
<DD> We maintain the <CODE>vergil-announce</CODE> alias for announcing
new vergil releases.  This alias is for Vergil announcements only.  Thus,
you cannot post to this group.  To subscribe to this group,
send email to <A HREF="mailto:vergil-announce-request@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>vergil-announce-request@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A>

<DT> <A NAME="downloading Vergil"><B>2.1 How do I download Vergil?</B></A>
<DD> <A HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/vergil/index.htm" target="_top"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/vergil.htm</CODE></A>
has links to the tar and zip files.

<DT> <A NAME="platforms that Vergil runs under"><B>2.2 What platforms does Vergil run under?</B></A>
<DD> Vergil was developed under JDK1.2.2 and JDK1.3.  We recommend JDK1.3 over JDK1.2.  Vergil requires Java 2 and Swing.
<p>The <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/plugin/" target="_top">Java Plug-in</a>
allows JDK1.1 browsers under Windows to run JDK1.3 applets.



<DT> <A NAME="vergil installation, what do I need"><B>2.3 What do I need to Install Vergil?</B></A>
<DD>
To run Vergil either in standalone mode or within a browser,
you will need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
<br>To compile Java files, you will need the Java Development Kit (JDK). 
<br>Both the JRE and the JDK may be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com" target="_top"><CODE>http://www.javasoft.com</CODE></A>.

 <p>Vergil uses <a href="http://www.gigascale.org/diva">Diva</a>, and a jar file of the Diva class files is included in the installation.

<DT> <A NAME="vergil troubleshooting overview"><B>2.4 Troubleshooting</B></A>
<DD> The <A HREF="troubleshooting.htm">Vergil Troubleshooting</A> guide
has a few hints.

 <P>You might find useful information on the Vergil homepage at
<A HREF="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/vergil" target="_top"><CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/java/vergil</CODE></A>.

 <P>If you are really stumped, you can send mail to <A
HREF="mailto:neuendor@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu"><CODE>neuendor@ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu</CODE></A>.
Your mail should include:
<OL>
<LI> What version of Vergil you are running.
<LI> What platform you are running under (Solaris, Windows etc.)
<LI> Exactly how to reproduce the bug.
</OL>

Please realize that due to the extensible nature of Vergil, bugs that appear
when using Vergil are often bugs in other related software.
