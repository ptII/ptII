 Instances of this class represent audio data equivalent to that
 contained by a Sun/NeXT audio file (.au file).  The class also
 includes a set of utility static methods for manipulating audio
 signals.
 Currently, only an 8kHz sample rate, mu-law encoded, monophonic
 audio format is supported.

 The format of an audio file is:
