/**
 Implementation of LiveSoundInterface that in dependent on javax. 
 This actor sequentially outputs audio samples that are captured
 from the audio input port of the computer. The audio input port
 typically corresponds to either the microphone input, line-in,
 or cd audio from the cdrom or dvd drive. It is not possible to
 select the desired input port under Java. This must be done from
 the operating system. This actor should be fired often enough to
 prevent overflow of the internal audio capture buffer.
 Overflow should be avoided, since it will result in loss of
 data. Each captured audio sample is converted to a double that
 may range from -1.0 to 1.0. Thus, the output type of this actor
 is DoubleToken.
