/**
 This class is a buffer that supports the reading of audio samples
 from a sound file that is specified as a URL. Specifically, this
 buffer supports the reading of double-valued audio samples. The
 maximum valid range of sample values is from -1.0 to 1.0. Any
 values outside of this range will be hard-clipped to fall within
 this range.
 <p>
 <b>Supported file types</b>
 <p>
 Valid sound file formats are WAVE (.wav), AIFF (.aif, .aiff),
 AU (.au). Valid sample rates are 8000, 11025, 22050, 44100, and
 48000 Hz. Both 8 bit and 16 bit audio are supported. Mono and
 stereo files are supported.
 <p>
 <b>Usage</b>
 <p>
 The path to the sound file, specified as a URL, is given as a
 constructor parameter. The constructor also takes an array
 length parameter, which is explained below. The constructor will
 attempt to open the specified file.
 <p>
 After invoking the constructor, the getSamples() method should
 be repeatedly invoked to read samples from the specified sound
 file. The getSamples() method takes a multidimensional array
 as a parameter. The first index represents the channel number
 (0 for first channel, 1 for  second channel, etc.). The second
 index represents the sample index within a channel. For each
 channel i, the size of the array, getSamplesArray[i].length, must
 be equal to the constructor parameter getSamplesArraySize.
 Otherwise an exception will occur. When the end of the sound
 file is reached, this method will return null.
 <p>
 The getChannels(), getSampleRate(), and getBitsPerSample()
 methods may be invoked at any time to obtain information about
 the format of the sound file.
 <p>
 When no more samples are desired, the closeFile() method should
 be invoked to close the sound file. An exception will occur if
 getSamples() is invoked at any point after closeFile() is invoked.
 <p>
 <b>Security Issues</b>
 <p>
 Applications have no restrictions on the  capturing or playback
 of audio. Applets, however, may by default only capture
 audio from a file specified as a URL on the same machine as the
 one the applet was loaded from. Applet code is not allowed to
 read or write native files. The .java.policy file may be
 modified to grant applets more privileges.
 <p>
 Note: Requires Java 2 v1.3.0 or later.
