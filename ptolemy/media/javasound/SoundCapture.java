/**
 A buffer supporting the capturing of audio samples from a file or
 from the computer's audio input port.

 <h2>Overview</h2>
 A buffer supporting the capturing of audio samples from a file or
 from the computer's audio input port. This class supports the
 real-time capture of audio from the audio input port (mic or line-in)
 as well as the capture of audio from a sound file specified as
 a URL. Single channel
 (mono) and multichannel audio (stereo) are supported. This class,
 along with SoundPlayback, intends to provide an easy to use interface
 to Java Sound, Java's audio API. Java Sound supports the capture
 of audio data, but only at the byte level, which is audio format
 specific. This class, however, provides higher level support for the
 capture of double or integer valued samples from the computer's audio
 input port or any supported sound file type. This class is therefore
 useful when it one desires to capture audio samples in an audio format
 independent way.
 <p>
 Depending on available audio
 system resources, it may be possible to run an instance of this
 class and an instance of SoundPlayback concurrently. This allows
 for the concurrent capture, signal processing, and playback of audio data.
 <p>
 <h2>Usage</h2>
 Two constructors are provided. One constructor creates a sound capture
 object that captures from the line-in or microphone port.
 The operating system must be used
 to select between the microphone and line-in. This cannot be
 done using Java. If this
 constructor is used, there will be a small
 delay between the time that the audio enters the microphone or
 line-in and the time that the corresponding audio samples are
 available via getSamples() or getSamplesInt().
 This latency can be adjusted by setting the <i>bufferSize</i>
 constructor parameter. Another constructor creates a sound capture
 object that captures audio from a sound file specified as a URL.
 <p>
 After calling the appropriate constructor, startCapture()
 must be called to initialize the audio system for capture.
 The getSamples() or getSamplesInt() method should then be repeatedly
 invoked to obtain audio data in the form of a multidimensional
 array of audio sample values. getSamples() will return audio
 sample values in the range [-1, 1]. getSamplesInt() will return
 audio samples in the range
 (-2^(bits_per_sample/2), 2^(bits_per_sample/2)), where
 bits_per_sample is the number of bits per sample.
 For the case where
 audio is captured from the mic or line-in, it is important to
 invoke getSamples() or getSamplesInt() often enough to prevent
 overflow of
 the internal audio buffer. The size of the internal buffer is
 set in the constructor. Note that it is possible (but probably
 not useful) to interleave calls to getSamples() and
 getSamplesInt().
 Finally, after no more audio data is desired, stopCapture()
 should be called to free up audio system resources.
 <p>
 <h2>Security issues</h2>
 Applications have no restrictions on the
 capturing or playback of audio. Applets, however, may only capture
 audio from a file specified as a URL on the same machine as the
 one the applet was loaded from. Applet code is not allowed to
 read or write native files. The .java.policy file must be
 modified to grant applets more privileges.
 <p>
 Note: Requires Java 2 v1.3.0 or later.
