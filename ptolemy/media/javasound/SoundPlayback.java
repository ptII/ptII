/**
 A buffer supporting the playback of audio data and the the
 writing of audio data to a sound file.

 <h2>Overview</h2>
 A buffer supporting the real-time playback of audio and the writing
 of audio data to a sound file. Single channel
 (mono) and multichannel audio (stereo) are supported. This class,
 along with SoundCapture, intends to provide an easy to use interface
 to Java Sound, Java's audio API. Java Sound supports the writing
 of audio data to a sound file or the computer's audio output port,
 but only at the byte level, which is audio format specific. This class,
 however, provides higher level support for the writing of double
 or integer valued samples to the computer's audio output port or
 any supported sound file type. This class is therefore useful when
 it one desires to playback audio samples in an audio format independent
 way.
 <p>
 Depending on available system resources, it may be possible to
 run an instance of this class and an instance of SoundCapture
 concurrently. This allows for the concurrent capture, signal
 processing, and playback of audio data.
 <p>
 <h2>Usage</h2>
 Two constructors are provided. One constructor creates a sound playback
 object that sends audio data to the speaker. If this constructor is
 used, there will be a small
 delay between the time that the audio data is delivered to this
 object and the time that the corresponding audio is actually
 heard. This latency can be adjusted by setting the <i>bufferSize</i>
 constructor parameter.  Another constructor
 creates a sound playback object that sends audio data to a sound
 file.
 <p>
 After calling the appropriate constructor, startPlayback()
 must be called to initialize the audio system.
 The putSamples() or putSamplesInt() method should then be repeatedly
 called to deliver the audio data to the audio output device
 (speaker or file). The audio samples delivered to putSamples()
 should be in the proper range, or clipping will occur.
 putSamples() expects the samples to be in the range (-1, 1).
 putSamplesInt() expects the samples to be in the range
 (-2^(bits_per_sample/2), 2^(bits_per_sample/2)), where
 bits_per_sample is the number of bits per sample.
 Note that it is possible (but probably
 not useful) to interleave calls to putSamples() and
 putSamplesInt().
 Finally, after no more audio playback is desired, stopPlayback()
 should be called to free up audio system resources.
 <p>
 <h2>Security issues</h2>Applications have no restrictions on the
 capturing or playback of audio. Applet code is not allowed to
 write native files by default. The .java.policy file must be
 modified to grant applets more privileges.
 <p>
 Note: Requires Java 2 v1.3.0 or later.
