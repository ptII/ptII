/**
 This class supports live capture and playback of audio
 samples. For audio capture, audio samples are captured
 from the audio input port of the computer. The audio input
 port is typically associated with the line-in port,
 microphone-in port, or cdrom audio-in port.
 For audio playback, audio samples are written to
 the audio output port. The audio output port is typically
 associated with the headphones jack or the internal
 speaker of the computer.
 <p>
 <b>Format of audio samples</b>
 <p>
 In this class, audio samples are double-valued and have a
 valid range of [-1.0, 1.0]. Thus when this class is used
 for audio capture, the returned samples will all range in
 value from -1.0 to 1.0. When this class is used for audio
 playback, the valid range of input samples is from -1.0 to
 1.0. Any samples that are outside of this range will be
 hard-clipped to fall within this range.
 <p>
 <b>Supported audio formats</b>
 <p>
 This class supports the subset of the hardware supported
 audio formats that are also supported under Java. Provided
 that the computer has a sound card that was manufactured
 after 1998, the following formats are likely to be supported.
 <ul>
 <li><i>channels</i>: Mono (channels = 1) and stereo
 (channels = 2) audio is supported. Note that some newer sound
 cards support more than two channels, such as 4 input, 4 output
 channels or better. Java does not support more than two
 channels, however. The default value assumed by this class is
 mono (1 channel). The number of channels may be set by the
 setChannels() method and read by the getChannels method().
 <li><i>sample rates</i>: 8000, 11025, 22050, 44100, and
 48000 Hz are supported. Note that some newer sound cards
 support 96000 Hz sample rates, but this is not supported under
 Java. The default sample rate used by this class is 8000 Hz.
 The sample rate may be set by the setSampleRate() method and
 read by the getSampleRate() method.
 <li><i>bit resolution</i>: 8 bit and 16 bit audio is supported.
 Note that some newer sound cards support 20 bit, 24 bit, and 32
 bit audio, but this is not supported under Java. The default
 bit resolution used by this class is 16 bit audio. The bit
 resolution may be set by the setBitsPerSample() method and
 read by the getBitsPerSample() method.
 </ul>
 <p>
 <b>Input/output latency</b>
 <p>
 When capturing audio samples, there will be some delay (latency)
 from the time the sound arrives at the input port to the time
 that the corresponding audio samples are available from this
 class. Likewise, there will be some delay from the time sample
 are written until the corresponding audio signal reaches the
 output port (e.g., the speaker). This is because an internal
 buffer is used to temporarily store audio samples when they are
 captured or played. The size of this internal buffer affects
 the latency in that a lower bound on the capture (playback)
 latency is given by (<i>bufferSize</i> / <i>sampleRate</i>)
 seconds. Here, <i>bufferSize</i> parameter is the size of the
 buffer in samples per channel. This class provides a method,
 setBufferSize(), to simultaneously set the size of internal
 capture buffer and the internal playback buffer. The method
 getBufferSize() may be used to read the buffer size. The default
 size of the internal buffer is 4096 samples.
 <p>
 <b>Constraints</b>
 <p>
 This class requires that the sample rate, number of channels,
 bit resolution, and internal buffer size be the same for both
 capture and playback. The motivation for this constraint is to
 simplify usage. Most audio hardware requires this anyway.
 <p>
 <b>Usage: audio capture</b>
 <p>
 First, call the appropriate methods to set the desired audio
 format parameters such as sample rate, channels, bit resolution
 if values other than the defaults are desired. The
 setTransferSize() method should also be invoked to set the size
 of the array (in samples per channel) that is returned when
 audio samples are captured. The default value is 128 samples
 per channel. Then invoke the startCapture(consumer) method to
 start the audio capture process. This class will be ready to
 capture audio immediately after startCapture() returns. Note
 that startCapture() takes an Object parameter, <i>consumer</i>.
 In addition to starting the audio capture process, startCapture()
 also grants an object permission to capture audio.
 <p>
 After calling startCapture(consumer), the consumer object can
 capture audio from the input port by calling getSamples(consumer).
 The getSamples() method returns an array of samples from the input
 port. The getSamples() blocks until the requested number of
 samples (which is set by the setTransferSize method) are available.
 Thus, it is not possible to call this method too frequently.
 Note that if getSamples() is not called frequently enough,
 the internal buffer will overflow and some audio data will
 be lost, which is generally undesirable. After the consumer
 object no longer wishes to capture audio, it should free up the
 audio system resources by calling the stopCapture(consumer)
 method. It should be noted that only one object may capture
 audio simultaneously from the audio input port. A future
 version of this class may support multiple objects capturing
 from the input port simultaneously.
 <p>
 <b>Usage: audio Playback</b>
 <p>
 First, call the appropriate methods to set the desired audio
 format parameters such as sample rate, channels, bit
 resolution if values other than the defaults are desired.
 The setTransferSize() method should also be invoked to set the
 size of the array (in samples per channel) that is supplied
 when audio samples are played. The default value is 128 samples
 per channel. Then invoke the startPlayback(producer) method
 to start the audio playback process. This class will be ready
 to playback audio immediately after startPlayback() returns.
 Note that startPlayback() takes an Object parameter,
 <i>producer</i>. In addition to starting the audio playback
 process, startPlayback() also grants an object permission to
 playback audio.
 <p>
 After calling startPlayback(producer), the producer object can
 playback audio to the output port by calling putSamples(producer).
 The putSamples() method takes an array of samples and sends the
 audio data to the output port. The putSamples() method blocks
 until the requested number of samples (which is set by the
 setTransferSize method) have been written to the output port.
 Thus, it is not possible to call this method too frequently.
 Note that if putSamples() is not called frequently enough,
 the internal buffer will underflow, causing audible artifacts
 in the output signal. After the producer object no longer wishes
 to playback audio, it should free up the audio system resources
 by calling the stopPlayback(producer) method. It should be noted
 that only one object may playback audio simultaneously to the
 audio output port. A future version of this class may support
 multiple objects playing to the output port simultaneously.
