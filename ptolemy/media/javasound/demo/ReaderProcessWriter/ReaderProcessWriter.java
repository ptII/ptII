/** This is a simple application that demonstrates the use of SoundReader
 and SoundWriter by performing soft clipping on an input sound file.


 Samples are read from a sound file specified as a URL, simple
 *  processing is performed on the audio date, and the processed data is written to a sound file.
 *  For this application, the processing consists
 *  of a simple soft clipping operation.
