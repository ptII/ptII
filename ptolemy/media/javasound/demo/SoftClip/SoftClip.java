/**
 A simple application that demonstrates the use of LiveSound by
 performing soft clipping in real-time.  This application performs
 real-time capture, processing, and playback of audio data.  Sound
 samples are captured from the computer's audio input port. The
 processing consists of a simple soft-clipping function (the arc
 tangent is used). The soft-clipped audio data is then played out
 the speaker.
