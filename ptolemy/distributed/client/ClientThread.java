/**
 Thread that manages the interaction with the remote service. It is required
 to allow commands to be issued to the remote services in parallel. This
 threads prevent the main thread of execution to be blocked by the remote
 calls    to the remote services. A synchronization mechanism to issue and
 access commands is provided by ThreadSynchronizer.
