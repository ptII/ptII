////ThreadSynchronizer

/**
 Synchronizes the access to the commandsMap. In order to allow parallel
 execution of commands, the ClientThreads that manage remote actors locally
 in the DistributedSDFDirector have to be able to access the commands
 without blocking the main execution Thread in a synchronized manner.
 Commands are represented by integers. It provides mechanisms to issue
 sets of commands and synchronize the access to those commands by the
 client Threads.
 It is assumed that no new set of commands is issued before the previous
 set of commands has been processed. Every ClientThread is responsible to
 set itself as ready after performing a command.
