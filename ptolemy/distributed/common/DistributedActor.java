/**
 An DistributedActor is a distributed executable entity. This interface
 defines the common functionality in DistributedActorWrapper and further
 implementations of distributed Actors. It defines the <i>action methods</i>,
 which determine how an distributed object can be invoked. It should be
 implemented by distributed actors.
