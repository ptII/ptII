//// Relation

/**
 A Relation links ports, and therefore the entities that contain them.
 To link a port to a relation, use the link() method
 in the Port class.  To remove a link, use the unlink() method in the
 Port class.
 <p>
 Relations can also be linked to other Relations.
 To create such a link, use the link() method of this class.
 To remove such a link, use the unlink() method. A group of linked
 relations behaves exactly as if it were one relation directly linked
 to all the ports linked to by each relation. In particular, the
 connectedPortList() method of the Port class returns the same list
 whether a single relation is used or a relation group. The order
 in which the ports are listed is the order in which links were
 made between the port and relations in the relation group.
 It is not relevant which relation in a relation group the port
 links to.
 <p>
 Derived classes may wish to disallow links under certain circumstances,
 for example if the proposed port is not an instance of an appropriate
 subclass of Port, or if the relation cannot support any more links.
 Such derived classes should override the protected method _checkPort()
 or _checkRelation() to throw an exception.
