//// Entity

/**
 An Entity is a vertex in a generalized graph. It is an aggregation
 of ports. The ports can be linked to relations. The
 relations thus represent connections between ports, and hence,
 connections between entities. To add a port to an entity, simply
 set its container to the entity.  To remove it, set its container
 to null, or to some other entity.
 <p>
 Entities are intended for flat graphs. Derived classes support
 hierarchy (clustered graphs) by defining entities that aggregate
 other entities.
 <p>
 An Entity can contain any instance of Port.  Derived classes may
 wish to constrain to a subclass of Port.  To do this, subclasses
 should override the public method newPort() to create a port of
 the appropriate subclass, and the protected method _addPort() to throw
 an exception if its argument is a port that is not of the appropriate
 subclass.
 <p>
 An Entity is created within a workspace.  If the workspace is
 not specified as a constructor argument, then the default workspace
 is used. The workspace is used to synchronize simultaneous accesses
 to a topology from multiple threads.  The workspace is immutable
 (it cannot be changed during the lifetime of the Entity).
