/**
 This is an interface for attributes that can have their values
 externally set.  An attribute class that implements this interface has to
 be able to have a value set by a string, via the setExpression()
 method.  A string representation is returned by the getExpression()
 method.  An expression may be an ordinary string with no further
 interpretation, or it may be a string that needs to be evaluated.
 In the latter case, an implementation of this attribute may not
 evaluate the string when the setExpression() method is called.
 It may instead only evaluate the string when the validate() method
 is called.  Often this will not be called until the value of the
 expression is actually needed (this is known as "lazy evaluation").
 Such an implementation will defer notification of listeners and the
 container until the string is evaluated. In a typical use of this
 interface, therefore, it is necessary to be sure that validate()
 is called sometime after setExpression() is called.
 <p>
 In addition, an attribute class that implements this interface
 needs to maintain a list of listeners that are informed whenever
 the value of the attribute changes.  It should inform those
 listeners whenever setExpression() is called.
 <p>
 Among other uses, this interface marks attributes whose value
 can be set via the value attribute of a MoML property element.
 For example, if class XXX implements Settable, then the following
 is valid MoML:
 <pre>
 &lt;property name="xxx" class="XXX" value="yyy"/&gt;
 </pre>
 <p>
 This interface also supports annotations that hint to a user
 interface the level of visibility that an instance should have.
 The visibility is specified as one of the static instances of
 the inner class Visibility, currently NONE, EXPERT, FULL, and NOT_EDITABLE
 NONE indicates that the user should never see the instance,
 and should not be able to set its value through the user interface.
 EXPERT means that only expert users should see the instance.
 FULL means that the instance is always visible, and a user interface
 should always allow it to be set.
 NOT_EDITABLE is similar to FULL, except that the value of the
 expression is visible, but not editable by the user.  This is
 commonly used for feedback from the model.
