//// Instantiable

/**
 This interface is for objects that can be instantiated.  Such objects serve a
 role similar to "classes" in Java and other object oriented languages.
 They are Ptolemy II objects, but whose purpose is to serve as
 a factory for instances that are (deep) clones of themselves.  Normally,
 they play no role in the execution of a model, and their ports cannot
 be connected to other ports.
 <p>
 An object that implements this interface can be in one of two states.
 Either it is a class definition ({@link #isClassDefinition()} returns true)
 or it is not.  Only objects that are class definitions can be instantiated.
 Instantiation is done via the {@link #instantiate(NamedObj, String)}
 method. If an object
 is instantiated from this object, then the new object is called the "child"
 and this object is called the "parent." An instance of Instantiable can have
 at most one parent (returned by the {@link #getParent()} method), but it
 can have many children (returned by the {@link #getChildren()} method).
 An object may be both a child and a parent.
 <p>
 A child is required to be a deep clone of its parent. That is, every
 object deeply contained by the parent must have a corresponding object
 deeply contained by the child.  The object that is deeply contained
 by the parent is called the "prototype" and the object deeply contained
 by the child is called the "derived" object. A derived object has the
 same name relative to the child as the prototype has relative to the
 parent. Moreover, a derived object is an instance of the same Java
 class as the prototype.
 <p>
 This correspondence between a parent and child is called the
 "derivation invariant." Any correct implementation of this interface
 must ensure that the derivation invariant is always satisfied, even
 if the parent changes after the child was instantiated. If new objects
 are added to the parent, then derived objects must be added to the
 child.
