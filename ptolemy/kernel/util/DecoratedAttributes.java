////DecoratedAttributes

/**
An abstract class that represents a number of decorated attributes.

<p>A NamedObj can contain DecoratedAttributes. These are attributes that are
added by another NamedObj, called a decorator to this NamedObj.
An example is a code generator that has specific attributes such as
parameters that control the code code generator. These attributes
are added by the Decorator (the code generator), to the director (the "this" object).
These attributes are stored separately and can be retrieved by using
{@link NamedObj#getDecoratorAttributes(Decorator)} or
{@link NamedObj#getDecoratorAttributes(Decorator)}.</p>

<p>A DecoratedAttributes instance has a decorator and
decoratored attributes.
The container of this class is the object that is being decorated.</p>

<p>The implementation class is {@link ptolemy.kernel.DecoratedAttributesImplementation},
the functionality is divided in two classes to solve dependency issues.
