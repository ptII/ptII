//// CrossRefList

/**

 CrossRefList is a list that maintains pointers to other CrossRefLists.
 CrossRefList is meant to be used to keep track of links between ports
 and relations in Ptolemy II.  It is a highly specialized form of a
 list.  An instance has a container (an Object), which is immutable,
 meaning that the container cannot be changed after the instance is
 constructed.  CrossRefList enumerators and query methods do not return
 references to other CrossRefLists; instead, references to the
 containers of the CrossRefLists (which can be any Object) are
 returned.

 <p>
 For efficiency, CrossRefList maintains a list of pairwise links
 between Objects (CrossRefs). That is, each member of a set of objects
 has a list of references to other members of the set, and each
 reference has a similar list that contains a corresponding back
 reference. Each reference list is an instance of . The class
 is used as if it were a simple list of references to objects, but it
 ensures the symmetry of the references, and supports efficient removal
 of links.  Removing a reference in one list automatically updates N
 back-references in O(N) time, independent of the sizes of the
 cross-referenced lists.
 <p>
 It is possible to create links at specified points in the list (called
 the <i>index number</i>).  This may result in gaps in the list at
 lower index numbers.  Gaps are representing by null in an enumeration
 of the list.
