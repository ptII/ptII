//// PtestWorkspace

/**

 This object implements a ptolemy thread that obtains read permission to
 a workspace three times sequentially, then obtains write permission.
 To use it, create an instance and then call its start() method.
 To obtain a profile of what it did, call its profile() method.
 That will return only after the thread completes.
 NOTE: This is a very primitive test.  It does not check very much.
