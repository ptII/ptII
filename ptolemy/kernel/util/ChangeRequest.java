//// ChangeRequest

/**
 Abstract base class for change requests.  A change request is any
 modification to a model that might be performed during execution of the
 model, but where there might only be certain phases of execution during
 which it is safe to make the modification.  Such changes are also called
 <i>mutations</i>.
 <p>
 A typical use of this class is to define an anonymous inner class that
 implements the _execute() method to bring about the desired change.
 The instance of that anonymous inner class is then queued with
 an instance of NamedObj using its requestChange() method.
 The execute() method must be called only once; attempting to call
 it multiple times will trigger an exception.
 <p>
 Concrete derived classes can be defined to implement
 mutations of a certain kind or in a certain way. Instances of these
 classes should be queued with a NamedObj, just like an anonymous
 inner class extending this class. MoMLChangeRequest is such a concrete
 derived class, where the mutation is specified as MoML code.
