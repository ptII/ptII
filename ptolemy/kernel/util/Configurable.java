//// Configurable

/**
 Objects that can be configured by reading a file or configuration information
 given as text, typically in XML format, should implement this interface.
 This enables a user of a component to recognize that such file-based
 configuration is possible, and permits configuration to be specified
 via the MoML configure element.
 For example, a plotter actor implements this interface to
 allow the visual appearance of the plot to be set using PlotML.
 An icon for an actor implements this interface to allow
 the actor-specific visual features of the icon to be
 specified using graphics markup.
 Additionally, a filter actor could implement this interface to allow
 the filter specification to be given using markup.
 <p>
 This interface can also be used for actors which load configuration
 information from non-XML formats, such as GIF images or binary lookup tables.
 The <i>source</i> argument of the configure() method simply points
 to such a file.
 <p>
 This interface is designed to be reversible, so that an object can also
 provide enough information to reconstruct its current configuration.
 This mechanism is used when writing MoML from instantiated objects, although
 it could also be used to write a description of the object in other forms.
 In order for this to work properly calling the configure() method on
 any object of the same type, given the data returned by the getConfigureSource() and
 getConfigureText() methods should result in an object that resemble the
 first as closely as possible.
