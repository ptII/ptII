/**
 A marker interface for lazy composites. A lazy composite is a
 CompositeEntity that does not automatically populate itself
 with contained entities and relations when it is instantiated.
 It does populate itself with attributes and ports, but the
 contained entities and relations are not created until they
 are explicitly requested.
 <p>
 Note that a class that implements this interface cannot
 have parameters whose values are expressions that refer to
 contained entities or relations or attributes contained by
 those. This is a rather esoteric use of expressions, so
 this limitation may not be onerous.
