/**
 This is an interface for objects with a name and a container. A simple
 name is an arbitrary string that identifies the object in the context of
 its container. In addition, the interface supports a
 "full name" which in implementation should identify both the container
 and the individual object. The implementations in the kernel package
 define the full name of an object to be the full name of its container
 followed by a period followed by the simple name of the object.
 Periods and braces are not permitted in the name.
