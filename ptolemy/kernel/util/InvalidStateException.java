//// InvalidStateException

/**
 Some object or set of objects has a state that is not
 permitted. E.g., a NamedObj has a null name. Or a topology has
 inconsistent or contradictory information in it, e.g. an entity
 contains a port that has a different entity as it container. Our
 design should make it impossible for this exception to ever occur,
 so occurrence is a bug.
