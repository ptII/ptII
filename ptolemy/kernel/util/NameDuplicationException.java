//// NameDuplicationException

/** Thrown on an attempt to add a named object to a collection that
 requires unique names, and finding that there already is an object
 by that name in the collection.
 Constructors are provided that take 1 or 2 Nameable references
 plus an arbitrary String.  The constructors are robust in that null
 references are ignored.  The preferred constructors are those that
 take two named objects (the container and the would-be containee),
 or two named objects and an arbitrary string (which can be used to
 provide additional information about the error).

 <p>This class has no constructors that take a Throwable cause because
 no such constructors have been needed, but in principle, such constructors
 could be added if needed.
