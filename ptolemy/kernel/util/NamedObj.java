//// NamedObj

/**
 This is a base class for almost all Ptolemy II objects.
 <p>
 This class supports a naming scheme, change requests, a persistent
 file format (MoML), a mutual exclusion mechanism for models (the
 workspace), an error handler, and a hierarchical class mechanism
 with inheritance.
 <p>
 An instance of this class can also be parameterized by attaching
 instances of the Attribute class.
 Instances of Attribute can be attached by calling their setContainer()
 method and passing this object as an argument. Those instances will
 then be reported by the {@link #getAttribute(String)},
 {@link #getAttribute(String, Class)}, {@link #attributeList()}
 and {@link #attributeList(Class)} methods.
 Classes derived from NamedObj may constrain attributes to be a
 subclass of Attribute.  To do that, they should override the protected
 _addAttribute(Attribute) method to throw an exception if
 the object provided is not of the right class.
 <p>
 An instance of this class has a name.
 A name is an arbitrary string with no periods.  If no
 name is provided, the name is taken to be an empty string (not a null
 reference). An instance also has a full name, which is a concatenation
 of the container's full name and the simple name, separated by a
 period. If there is no container, then the full name begins with a
 period. The full name is used for error reporting throughout Ptolemy
 II.
 <p>
 Instances of this class are associated with a workspace, specified as
 a constructor argument.  The reference to the workspace is immutable.
 It cannot be changed during the lifetime of this object.  It is used for
 synchronization of methods that depend on or modify the state of
 objects within it. If no workspace is specified, then the default
 workspace is used.  Note that the workspace should not be confused
 with the container.  The workspace never serves as a container.
 <p>
 In this base class, the container is null by default, and no
 method is provided to change it. Derived classes that support
 hierarchy provide one or more methods that set the container.
 By convention, if the container is set,
 then the instance should be removed from the workspace directory, if
 it is present.  The workspace directory is expected to list only
 top-level objects in a hierarchy.  The NamedObj can still use the
 workspace for synchronization.  Any object contained by another uses
 the workspace of its container as its own workspace by default.
 <p>
 This class supports <i>change requests</i> or <i>mutations</i>,
 which are changes to a model that are performed in a disciplined
 fashion.  In particular, a mutation can be requested via the
 {@link #requestChange(ChangeRequest)} method. By default, when
 a change is requested, the change is executed immediately.
 However, by calling {@link #setDeferringChangeRequests(boolean)},
 you can ensure that change requests are queued to be executed
 only when it is safe to execute them.
 <p>
 This class supports the notion of a <i>model error</i>, which is
 an exception that is handled by a registered model error handler, or
 passed up the container hierarchy if there is no registered model
 error handler.  This mechanism complements the exception mechanism in
 Java. Instead of unraveling the calling stack to handle exceptions,
 this mechanism passes control up the Ptolemy II hierarchy.
 <p>
 Derived classes should override the _description() method to
 append new fields if there is new information that should be included
 in the description.
 
 <p>
 A NamedObj can contain DecoratedAttributes. These are attributes that are
 added by another NamedObj, called a decorator to this NamedObj.
 An example is for example a code generator. This one has specific attributes
 for for example the generated code of the director in a model. These attributes
 are added by the Decorator (the code generator), to the director ("this" object).
 These attributes are stored seperately and can be retrieved by using
 {@link #getDecoratorAttributes(Decorator)} or
 {@link #getDecoratorAttributes(Decorator)}.
