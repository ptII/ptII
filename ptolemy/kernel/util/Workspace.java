 Made _writer, _lastReader, _lastReaderRecord, and _readerRecords
 transient so that object would be serializable. However, serialization
 is probably not right if there are outstanding read or write permissions.

//// Workspace

/**
 An instance of Workspace is used for synchronization and version tracking
 of interdependent groups of objects.  These objects are said to be in the
 workspace. This is not the same as the <i>container</i> association
 in Ptolemy II.  A workspace is never returned by a getContainer() method.
 <p>
 The workspace provides a rudimentary directory service that can
 be used to keep track of the objects within it.  It is not required to use
 it in order to use the workspace for synchronization. Items are added
 to the directory by calling add().
 The names of the items in the directory are not required to be unique.
 <p>
 The synchronization model of the workspace is a multiple-reader,
 single-writer model. Any number of threads can simultaneously read the
 workspace. Only one thread at a time can have write access to the workspace,
 and while the write access is held, no other thread can get read access.
 <p>
 When reading the state of objects in the workspace, a thread must
 ensure that no other thread is simultaneously modifying the objects in the
 workspace. To read-synchronize on a workspace, use the following code:
 <pre>
 try {
 _workspace.getReadAccess();
 // ... code that reads
 } finally {
 _workspace.doneReading();
 }
 </pre>
 We assume that the _workspace variable references the workspace, as for example
 in the NamedObj class. The getReadAccess() method suspends the current thread
 if another thread is currently modifying the workspace, and otherwise
 returns immediately. Note that multiple readers can simultaneously have
 read access. The finally clause is executed even if
 an exception occurs.  This is essential because without the call
 to doneReading(), the workspace will never again allow any thread
 to modify it.
 <p>
 To make safe changes to the objects in a workspace, a thread must
 write-synchronize using the following code:
 <pre>
 try {
 _workspace.getWriteAccess();
 // ... code that writes
 } finally {
 _workspace.doneWriting();
 }
 </pre>
 Again, the call to doneWriting() is essential, or the workspace
 will remain permanently locked to either reading or writing.
 <p>
 Note that it is not necessary to obtain a write lock just to add
 an item to the workspace directory.  The methods for accessing
 the directory are all synchronized, so there is no risk of any
 thread reading an inconsistent state.
 <p>
 A major subtlety in using this class concerns acquiring a write
 lock while holding a read lock. If a thread holds a read lock
 and calls getWriteAccess(), if any other thread holds a read lock,
 then the call to getWriteAccess() will block the calling thread
 until those other read accesses are released. However, while
 the thread is blocked, it yields its read permissions. This
 prevents a deadlock from occurring, but it means that the
 another thread may acquire write permission while the thread
 is stalled and modify the model.  Specifically, the pattern
 is:
 <pre>
     try {
        _workspace.getReadAccess();
        ... do things ...
        try {
           _workspace.getWriteAccess();
           ... at this point, the structure of a model may have changed! ...
           ... make my own changes knowing that the structure may have changed...
        } finally {
           _workspace.doneWriting();
        }
        ... continue doing things, knowing the model may have changed...
     } finally {
        _workspace.doneReading();
     }
  </pre>
  Unfortunately, a user may acquire a read access and invoke a method
  that, unknown to the user, acquires write access. For this reason, it
  is very important to document methods that acquire write access, and
  to avoid invoking them within blocks that hold read access. Note that
  there is no difficulty acquiring read access from within a block
  holding write access.
