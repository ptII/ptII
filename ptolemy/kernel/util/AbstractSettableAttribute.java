/**
 This is an abstract base class for attributes that implement the
 Settable interface. In particular, it provides a default implementation
 of the getDefaultExpression() method.  If this object is derived from
 another, then the default value is obtained from that other.
 Otherwise, the default value is the first value set using
 setExpression().
