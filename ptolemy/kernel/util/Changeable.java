/**
 This is an interface for objects that support change requests that can
 be deferred.  A change request is any
 modification to a model that might be performed during execution of the
 model, but where there might only be certain phases of execution during
 which it is safe to make the modification.  Such changes are also called
 <i>mutations</i>.
 <p>
 A change request is typically made by instantiating a subclass of
 ChangeRequest (possibly using an anonymous inner class) and then passing
 it to the requestChange() method of an object implementing this interface.
 That object may delegate the request (for example, it might consolidate
 all such requests at the top level of the hierarchy by passing the
 request to its container).  If it does delegate, then it is expected
 to consistently delegate all commands to the same object.
 <p>
 When a change request is made, if it is safe to do so, then an
 implementor of this interface is free to immediately execute
 the request, unless setDeferringChangeRequests(true) has been called.
 It is never safe to execute a change request if the implementor
 is already in the middle of executing a change request (that
 execution may have triggered the request).
