/**
 Default model error handler.  A model error is an exception that is
 passed up the Ptolemy II hierarchy for handling until a container with
 a registered error handler is found.  If there is no registered error
 handler, then the error is ignored.  It is like throwing an exception, except
 that instead of unraveling the calling stack, it travels up the Ptolemy II
 hierarchy.  This class handles the error by simply throwing the
 exception that has been passed to it.
