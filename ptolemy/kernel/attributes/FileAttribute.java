//// FileAttribute

/**
 This is an attribute that specifies a file or URL.  The value of this
 attribute, accessed by getExpression(), is a string that names a file
 or URL. If the model containing this attribute has been saved to a
 MoML file, then the file name can be given relative to the directory
 containing that MoML file.  If the model has not been saved to a file,
 then the classpath is used for identifying relative file names.
 <p>
 Files can be given relative to a <i>base</i>, where the base is
 the URI of the first container above this one that has a URIAttribute.
 Normally, this URI specifies the file or URL containing the model
 definition. Thus, files that are referred to here can be kept in the
 same directory as the model, or in a related directory, and can
 moved together with the model.
 <p>
 The following special file names are understood:
 <ul>
 <li> System.in: Standard input.
 <li> System.out: Standard output.
 </ul>
 Note, however, that these file names cannot be converted to URLs
 using the asURL() method.
 <p>
 A file name can also contain the following strings that start
 with "$", which get substituted
 with the appropriate values
 <table>
 <tr>
 <th>String</th>
 <th>Description</th>
 <th>Property</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <tr><code>$CWD</code></tr>
 <tr>The current working directory</tr>
 <tr><code>user.dir</code></tr>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <tr><code>$HOME</code></tr>
 <tr>The user's home directory</tr>
 <tr><code>user.home</code></tr>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <tr><code>$PTII</code></tr>
 <tr>The home directory of the Ptolemy II installation</tr>
 <tr><code>ptolemy.ptII.dir</code></tr>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <tr><code>$TMPDIR</code></tr>
 <tr>The temporary directory</tr>
 <tr><code>java.io.tmpdir</code></tr>
 </tr>
 </table>
 The above properties are normally set when a Ptolemy II application starts.
 <p>
 If a file name begins with the string "$CLASSPATH", followed by either
 "/" or "\", then when the file
 is opened for reading, the openForReading() method
 will search for the file relative to the classpath (using the
 getResource() method of the current class loader).  This will only
 work for a file that exists, and thus the openForWriting() method
 will not understand the "$CLASSPATH" string; this makes sense
 since the classpath typically has several directories, and it
 would not be obvious where to create the file.  The asURL()
 method also recognizes the "$CLASSPATH" string, but not the asFile()
 method (which is typically used when accessing a file for writing).
