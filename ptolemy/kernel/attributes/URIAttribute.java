//// URIAttribute

/**
 An attribute that identifies the URI from which the container was read.
 This attribute is not persistent by default.  That is, it exports no
 MoML description. This makes sense because it should be set by the
 code that reads the container's specification.  It is also a singleton,
 meaning that it will replace any previous attribute that has the same
 name and is an instance of the base class, SingletonAttribute.
 <p>
 In most cases, this URI will specify a URL.  The difference between
 a URL and a URI is that a URI is unevaluated. That is, it is a string
 representation of a resource, without any assurance or indication of a
 file, stream, or other associated network resource.  To access a URI,
 it is common to create a URL from its specification.

 <p>Unfortunately, URLs are not necessarily valid URIs.  For example, a
 URL that has a space in it is not a valid URI, the space must be
 quoted (converted) to <code>%20</code>.
