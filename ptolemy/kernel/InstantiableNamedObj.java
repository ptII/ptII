//// InstantiableNamedObj

/**
 An InstantiableNamedObj is a named object that can be either a class
 definition or an instance.  If it is a class definition, then "instances" of
 that class definition can be created by the instantiate() method. Those
 instances are called the "children" of this "parent." Changes
 to the parent propagate automatically to the children as described
 in the {@link Instantiable} interface.
 <p>
 Note that the {@link #instantiate(NamedObj, String)} permits instantiating
 an object into a workspace that is different from the one associated with
 this object.  This means that some care must be exercised when propagating
 changes from a parent to a child, since they may be in different workspaces.
 Suppose for example that the change that has to propagate is made via a
 change request. Although it may be a safe time to execute a change request
 in the parent, it is not necessarily a safe time to execute a change request
 in the child.  Classes that restrict these safe times should override
 the propagateExistence(), propagateValue(), and propagateValues() methods
 to ensure that the destinations of the propagation are in a state that
 they can accept changes.
