//// ComponentEntity

/**
 A ComponentEntity is a component in a CompositeEntity.
 It might itself be composite, but in this base class it is assumed to
 be atomic (meaning that it cannot contain components).
 <p>
 Derived classes may further constrain the container to be
 a subclass of CompositeEntity.  To do this, they should override
 the protected method _checkContainer() to throw an exception.
 <p>
 A ComponentEntity can contain instances of ComponentPort.  Derived
 classes may further constrain to a subclass of ComponentPort.
 To do this, they should override the public method newPort() to create
 a port of the appropriate subclass, and the protected method _addPort()
 to throw an exception if its argument is a port that is not of the
 appropriate subclass.
