 This is an attribute that creates an editor for configuring and
 running a code generator.  This is designed to be contained by
 an instance of CodeGenerator or a subclass of CodeGenerator.
 It customizes the user interface for "configuring" the code
 generator. This UI will be invoked when you double click on the
 code generator.
