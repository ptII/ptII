/**
 Property hierarchy base class.
 Note that all public methods are synchronized.
 There are more than one instances of a property lattice.
 Although the property lattice is constructed once and then typically
 does not change during execution, the methods need to be synchronized
 because there are various data structures used to cache results that
 are expensive to compute. These data structures do change during
 execution. Multiple threads may be accessing the property lattice
 simultaneously and modifying these data structures. To ensure
 thread safety, the methods need to be synchronized.
