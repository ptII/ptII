/** A concept that represents the concept values of entries in a record token.
 *  
 *  A conceptable model element such as a port or node in a Ptolemy expression
 *  could contain a token value that is a record data type.  A record token
 *  is a token that is a collection of multiple token values of different
 *  types. For example, we might want to specify a record that indicates the
 *  (x,y) pixel position on a black-and-white screen, and also true or false
 *  for whether that pixel position is on or off.  We can use a record of the form:
 *  {x = 34, y = 26, pixelOn = true}
 *  <p>
 *  This RecordConcept allows any record to be assigned concept values for its
 *  individual elements from an arbitrary finite ontology. For example, if we
 *  wanted to assign a concept to the token above from the constAbstractInterpretation
 *  ontology, it would be:
 *  {x = Positive, y = Positive, pixelOn = BooleanTrue}
 *  
 *  This code is adapted from the
 *  {@link ptolemy.data.ontologies.lattice.adapters.monotonicityAnalysis.MonotonicityConcept}
 *  implementation.
