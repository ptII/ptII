/** An abstract class that defines the ordering relationships in an ontology.
 *  An ontology is a set of concepts and the relationships between them.  In a
 *  general ontology the graph describing the relationships between concepts
 *  need not be a complete partial order (CPO).  But we restrict our
 *  implementation to a CPO because we currently deal only with ontologies that
 *  can be partially ordered. This is particularly important for an ontology
 *  whose graph is a lattice, where we can use the Rehof and Mogensen algorithm
 *  to do a scalable analysis and inference on a model to assign concepts from
 *  the ontology to each element in the model.  This specialization is
 *  implemented as a
 *  {@linkplain ptolemy.data.ontologies.lattice.LatticeOntologySolver
 *  LatticeOntologySolver}, a subclass of {@linkplain OntologySolver}.
