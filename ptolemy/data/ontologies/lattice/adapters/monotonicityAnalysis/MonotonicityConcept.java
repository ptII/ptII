/** A concept that represents the monotoncity of an expression.
 *
 *  Note that for an arbitrary expression, it will not have a
 *  monotonicity concept of simply Monotonic, Constant, etc.
 *  Rather, the expression will have a monotonicity that depends
 *  on it's free variables.  For example, an expression of the form
 *  <code>
 *    (x &lt;= Concept1) ? Bottom :
 *    (y &lt;= Concept2) ? Top :
 *    Concept1
 *  </code>
 *  may have a monotonicity that is monotonic with respect to the
 *  variable x, but antimonotonic with respect to y (and constant
 *  with respect to all other variables).
 *
 *  This class represents exactly such concepts, representing them as
 *  {x = Monotonic, y = Animonotonic}, in a manner and syntax
 *  similar to records of the Ptolemy II type system.  In records,
 *  however, accessing an undefined tag is an error, whereas in
 *  expressions, they are simply constant with respect to any
 *  variables that are not free.
