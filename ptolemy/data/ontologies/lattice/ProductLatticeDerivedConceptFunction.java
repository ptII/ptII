/** A concept function that returns a derived concept from a given input
 *  concept for a product lattice ontology to be used for constraints
 *  generated from an ontology that is a component of the product lattice ontology.
 *  Whatever the input product lattice concept is, the output is a product
 *  lattice concept whose tuple preserves the value of the concept in the
 *  given component ontology, but sets the other concepts in the tuple to the
 *  bottom of their respective ontology lattices. This is used for constraints
 *  that are derived from the lattice ontology adapters of ontologies that
 *  comprise the product lattice ontology, so that their constraints are
 *  orthogonal to the other ontologies in the product lattice ontology.
