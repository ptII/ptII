/** A concept that is not part of a finite ontology.
 *  This class represents Concepts that, rather than being drawn from
 *  a fixed finite set of the elements in a ConceptGraph, are drawn
 *  from a potentially infinite set, such as those used to represent
 *  structured datatypes like records, concepts parameterized over values,
 *  and other situations where enumerating all possible concepts beforehand
 *  is not feasible.
 *  <p>
 *  Since this class aims to be a general superclass of any type of infinite
 *  concept, it does not provide any implementations that may be particular
 *  to a particular style of infinite concepts, and is abstract.
 *  Subclasses are responsible for determining exactly what type of infinite
 *  concept they will support.
