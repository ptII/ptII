/**
 The parse tree created from the expression string consists of a
 hierarchy of node objects. This class represents record construction using
 the following syntax: <code>{foo = "abc", bar = 1}</code>. The result of
 parsing and evaluating this expression is a record token with two fields:
 a field <i>foo</i> containing a StringToken of value "abc", and a field
 <i>bar</i> containing a IntToken of value 1.
