//// FixPointFunctions

/**
 This class provides static functions for operating on Fixpoint numbers
 in the Ptolemy II expression language. The added functionality is
 <ul>
 <li> Create a FixPoint for a double value with a particular
 precision. The result is an instance of <i>FixPoint</i>.
 For example:
 <pre>
 fix(5.34, 10, 4)
 </pre>
 creates a fixed point number with a total of 10 bits, 4 of which are
 integer bits, representing the number 5.34.
 <p>
 <li> Create a FixPointMatrix with entries that consist of instances of
 FixPoint. Each entry in the fixed point matrix has
 the same precision. For example,
 <pre>
 fix([ -.040609, -.001628, .17853, .37665, .37665, .17853,
 -.001628, -.040609 ], 10, 2)
 </pre>
 creates a matrix where each entry has 10 bits, two of which are
 integer bits.
 <p>
 <li> Create a DoubleToken whose value is the quantized version of the
 given double value. The value is quantized by converting it into a
 fixed point value with a particular precision and then back again to
 a double value.
 For example,
 <pre>
 quantize(5.34, 10, 4)
 </pre>
 quantizes the number 5.34 to 10 bits of precision, 4 of which
 are integer bits.
 <li>
 Create a matrix whose entries are the quantized version of the
 values of the given matrix. The values are quantized by converting
 them into a fixed point value with a particular precision and then
 back again into a double value. Each entry is quantized using the same
 precision. The result is an instance of <i>DoubleMatrixToken</i>.
 For example:
 <pre>
 quantize([ -.040609, -.001628, .17853, .37665, .37665, .17853,
 -.001628, -.040609 ], 10, 2)
 </pre>
 creates a new instance of DoubleMatrixToken containing the specified
 values with 10 bits of precision, two of which are integer bits.
 </ul>
 In all cases, rounding is used when quantization errors occur,
 and saturation is used when overflow occurs.
