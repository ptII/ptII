/**
 An interface to specify the containment relationship as seen by the model
 designer. This interface can be implemented by an attribute (such as {@link
 ptolemy.domains.fsm.kernel.ContainmentExtender}. Such an attribute defines a
 special containment relationship that is slightly different from the
 containment relationship defined by {@link NamedObj#getContainer()}. The {@link
 #getExtendedContainer()} method returns the container of the object that
 contains the implementing attribute. The returned container is supposed to be
 the object that visually contains the object that owns the implementing
 attribute, as seen by the model designer. In particular, for a modal model
 (either FSM or Ptera), even though a refinement is visually contained by a state
 or an event, {@link NamedObj#getContainer()} of that refinement does not return
 the state or event because of a difference between the visual representation
 and internal data representation. In that case, {@link #getExtendedContainer()}
 of this interface returns the state or event.
 <p>
 When the expression evaluator tries to resolve a variable name starting from an
 object, it checks whether an attribute implementing this interface is owned by
 the object if the variable cannot be found in that object. If one such
 attribute is found, the evaluator considers the container returned by {@link
 #getExtendedContainer()}, instead of the {@link NamedObj#getContainer()} that
 it normally uses.
