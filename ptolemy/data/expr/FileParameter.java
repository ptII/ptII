/**
 <p>This is an attribute that specifies a file or URL.  The value of this
 attribute, accessed by getExpression(), is a string that names a file
 or URL, possibly containing references to variables defined in scope
 using the syntax $ID, ${ID} or $(ID). The value returned by getToken()
 is name of the file with such references resolved.</p>
 <p>
 If this attribute contains a parameter named <i>allowFiles</i> with
 value false, then when a file browser is used to select a file,
 that file browser will be set to not show files (only directories
 will be shown).  If this attribute contains a parameter named
 <i>allowDirectories</i> with value true, then the file browser
 will permit the user to select directories (the default behavior
 is that when a directory is selected, that directory is opened
 and its contained files and directories are listed).</p>
 <p>
 If the model containing this
 attribute has been saved to a MoML file, then the file name can be
 given relative to the directory containing that MoML file.
 If the model has not been saved to a file,
 then the classpath is used for identifying relative file names.</p>
 <p>
 Files can be given relative to a <i>base</i>, where the base is
 the URI of the first container above this one that has a URIAttribute.
 Normally, this URI specifies the file or URL containing the model
 definition. Thus, files that are referred to here can be kept in the
 same directory as the model, or in a related directory, and can
 moved together with the model.</p>
 <p>
 The following special file names are understood:
 <ul>
 <li> System.in: Standard input.
 <li> System.out: Standard output.
 </ul>
 Note, however, that these file names cannot be converted to URLs
 using the asURL() method.
 A file name can also contain the following strings that start
 with "$", which get substituted
 with the appropriate values.</p>
 <table>
 <tr>
 <th>String</th>
 <th>Description</th>
 <th>Property</th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <tr><code>$CWD</code></tr>
 <tr>The current working directory</tr>
 <tr><code>user.dir</code></tr>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <tr><code>$HOME</code></tr>
 <tr>The user's home directory</tr>
 <tr><code>user.home</code></tr>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <tr><code>$PTII</code></tr>
 <tr>The home directory of the Ptolemy II installation</tr>
 <tr><code>ptolemy.ptII.dir</code></tr>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <tr><code>$TMPDIR</code></tr>
 <tr>The temporary directory</tr>
 <tr><code>java.io.tmpdir</code></tr>
 </tr>
 </table>
 <p>The above properties are normally set when a Ptolemy II application starts.</p>
 <p>
 If a file name begins with the reference "$CLASSPATH", then when
 the file is opened for reading, the openForReading() method
 will search for the file relative to the classpath (using the
 getResource() method of the current class loader).  This will only
 work for a file that exists, and thus the openForWriting() method
 will not understand the "$CLASSPATH" string; this makes sense
 since the classpath typically has several directories, and it
 would not be obvious where to create the file.  The asURL()
 method also recognizes the "$CLASSPATH" string, but not the asFile()
 method (which is typically used when accessing a file for writing).
 NOTE: If the container of this parameter also contains a variable
 named CLASSPATH, then the value of that variable is used instead
 of the Java classpath.</p>
