//// ASTPtMethodCallNode

/**
 The parse tree created from the expression string consists of a
 hierarchy of node objects. This class represents method call nodes
 in the parse tree.
 <p>
 To allow extension of the parser capabilities without modifying
 the kernel code, method calls on Tokens are supported with the following
 syntax  (token).methodName(comma separated arguments).
 <p>
 Method arguments are processed as described in {@link
 ASTPtFunctionApplicationNode}.  However, to allow element-by-element
 method calls on ArrayTokens, the following sequence is followed here
 to find a method to execute:
 <ul>
 <li>Look for a method with tokens as supplied by PtParser.</li>
 <li>If that fails, convert all instances of ArrayToken to Token[] and
 look again, element-by-element.</li>
 <li>If that fails, convert all method arguments to their underlying java
 types and try again.</li>
 <li>Finally, if the above fails, convert the method object Token to
 its underlying java type and try again.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
