/**
 A token that contains an actor.  This token allows components to be
 moved around in a model.  One subtlety is that actors are not,
 generally immutable objects.  In order to prevent the actor
 transmitted from appearing in multiple places in a model, and the
 semantic fuzziness that would result, the actor is always cloned when
 being retrieved from this token.
