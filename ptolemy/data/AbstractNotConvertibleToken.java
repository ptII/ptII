//// AbstractNotConvertibleToken

/**
 The Token base class provides a very general interface for building
 new data types.  However, in many ways, the interface is rather
 complex in order to allow operations between tokens that are defined
 in different classes.  In particular, this requires the duplicate
 operation() and operationReverse() methods.

 <p> This base class is intended to make it easy to implement tokens
 where operations are only defined for other tokens that are defined in
 the same class.  In these cases, the operation() and
 operationReverse() method can share the same code.  This class
 implements these methods to ensure that the argument of each operation
 is actually an instance of the correct class.  The implementation then
 defers to a protected _operation() method.  These protected methods
 should be overridden in derived classes to provide type-specific
 operations.

 <p> This class is used a base class for ArrayToken and RecordToken.
 Note that these classes actually represent tokens having different
 types in the type lattice.
