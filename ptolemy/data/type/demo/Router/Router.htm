This model illustrates the very sophisticated type system
in Ptolemy II, where type constraints propagate transparently.
This example illustrates composite types, where records are
constructed out of tokens with various types. Here, a record
models a packet in a packet-switched network, where variable
delays may result in out-of-order arrival of packets.
<P>
The <a href="RouterVergil.htm">block diagram</a>
for the model was constructed using the Ptolemy II schematic editor
called Vergil.
