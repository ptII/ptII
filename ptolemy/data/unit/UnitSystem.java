/**
 <p>A unit system as defined by a set of base and derived units.</p>
 <p>
 The various measurement units of a unit system are represented by the
 parameters of an instance of UnitSystem.
 The units belong to a number of categories, such as length and time
 in the International System of Units (SI). Each category has a base unit,
 for example meter in the length category.</p>
 <p>
 Several basic unit systems are provided with Ptolemy II. They are specified
 using MoML. Customized unit systems can be created following these examples.

    // 1. The entire notion of a category being indexed into a vector by an
    // integer is a little strange.  I don't think we have quite the right
    // storage structure here.  In anycase, it would be good to
    // discuss the implementation details in a comment inside the UnitSystem
    // method
    //
    // 2. Having static data makes for somewhat less robust code, especially
    // when there is no way to reset the static data, which is why I added a
    // reset() method.  UnitSystem has no way of removing a unit from
    // the static structures - what do I do if I screw up and add a bad unit?
