The model above simulates the RC decay for 1000 ohms in contact 
with 0.001 farad.
 <br>The integrator has been set to an initial charge of 5.0 volts
 <br>The voltage and current are sampled every 0.2 seconds.

 <p>A major source of errors in embedded software is incorrect application
of units. Yuhong Xiong and Xiaojun Liu have created a unit system for
Ptolemy II that is quite clever. A suite of constants are defined,
with
names such as "meter", "cm", "feet", "miles", "seconds", "hours", and
"days". In each unit category ("length" or "time" for example), there
is a primary unit with respect to which all the others are specified.
Thus, for example, if the primary unit of length is meters, then the
expression "1.0 * cm" will have an internal value of 0.01 * meters.
Compound units are specified by just multiplying and dividing, as in
for example "1.0 * cm/second".

 <p>The way this is realized is that these unit constants are
tokens just
like other Ptolemy II data, and multiplication and division are
overloaded in the base classes for numeric valued tokens.  We continue
to work on this architecture to enable users to customize the unit
system on a per-model basis.

<P>
The <a href="UnitsVergil.htm">block diagram</a>
for the model was constructed using the Ptolemy II schematic editor
called Vergil.
