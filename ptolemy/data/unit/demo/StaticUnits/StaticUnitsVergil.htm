<h1>StaticUnits</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>Demonstration of statically checked unit system.

This is a model of the growth process in a fermenter. There are three
submodels:

1) Growth models the number of cells being produced as a
    function of the current number of cells and the vat temperature;
2) HeatProduction models the amount of heat produced (in calories) as
    a function of the amount of work done (in joules); and
3) HeatExchanger models the removal of heat from the vat as a
    function of the rate at which water flows through the cooling
    jacket around the vat.

Some of the units constraints in the model are inconsistent. See the
red notes. The UnitsConstraint Solver can be used to discover, and
analyse these inconsistencies. (Right mouse-click and select
UnitsConstraint Solver).</p>
