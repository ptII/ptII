/**
 A token that contains an instance of FixPoint.  This token type
 exists solely so that types can be declared as UNSIZED_FIX through
 the parameter mechanism, since we don't represent types distinctly
 from tokens.  Generally speaking actors should process FixTokens,
 which properly report their precision.
