//// AbstractConvertibleToken

/**
 The Token base class provides a very general interface for building
 new data types.  However, in many ways, the interface is rather complex
 in order to allow consistent implementation of Token operations that
 operate on tokens that are defined in different classes.  In particular,
 this requires the duplicate operation and operationReverse methods.

 <p> This base class is intended to make it easy to implement tokens
 that perform operations on other data types.  In most (but not all)
 cases, these operations to be performed only on types that can be
 losslessly converted to this type (or vice versa).  The operations are
 implemented to first perform the conversion to the same type, and then
 to perform the operation.  This class provides a base class
 implementation of the operation methods which performs the appropriate
 conversion, and then defers to a protected _operation method if the
 type of the argument of the operation is less than or equal to this
 type.  If the argument type is greater than this type, then the
 appropriate method is called on that type.  If the types are
 incomparable, then this class throws an exception. The protected
 methods should be overridden in derived classes to provide
 type-specific operations.
