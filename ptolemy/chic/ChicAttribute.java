//// ChicAttribute

/**
 An attribute that has a string value which is meant to be used as an interface
 in Chic.
 Use setExpression() to define the value, as in for example
 <pre>
 attribute.setExpression("xxx");
 </pre>
 <p>The default value of the string contained by this attribute is the empty
 string.

 <p>By default, an instance of this class is fully visible in a user
 interface and it is annotated with a TextStyle attribute.  The
 visibility is indicated to the user interface when the user interface
 calls the getVisibility() method of this class and the value
 Settable.FULL is returned to the userInterface.

 <p>Note that the string value within ChicAttribute will not be parsed
 and you do not have to type a leading and a trailing double quote.

 <p>This class is an attribute that replaces any previously existing
 attribute of the same class in the container that has the same name.
