/**
 An analysis for the computation of transitive closure of a directed graph.
 While there is a path directed from node X to Y in the given graph,
 there is an edge from X to Y in the transformed graph. Generally, transitive
 closure is expressed in terms of square matrix with graph node labels as
 indices.
 <p>
 The {@link #transitiveClosureMatrix()} method returns the transitive closure of
 the graph in the form of a two dimensional array. The first dimension represents
 source node label while the second one represents sink node label.
 Assume i and j are labels of two nodes. Matrix[i][j] is true if there is a path
 on the graph from "i" to "j".
