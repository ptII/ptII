/**
 A base interface for transformers. Transformers are graph analyzers which
 transform a graph into another graph and they provide a bilateral way to
 retrieve the original elements of the graph from the new (transformed) ones
 and vice versa. If only unilateral relation is being considered,
 this can be communicated to the client through the {@link #hasBackwardMapping()}
 and {@link #hasForwardMapping()} methods.
