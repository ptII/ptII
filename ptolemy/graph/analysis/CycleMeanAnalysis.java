/**
 An analysis to calculate the maximum/minimum cycle mean of a directed
 cyclic graph.
 <p>
 The analyzer associated to this analysis, adds up the cost of the edges on
 different cycles and divides it by the number of edges in that cycle,
 then picks the maximum/minimum of them.
 <p>
 Strongly connected components are being processed separately, and the cycle
 mean has the maximum/minimum value among them.
 When there are multiple edges between two nodes, the edge with the
 maximum/minimum weight is considered for the cycle that gives the
 maximum/minimum cycle mean.

 <p>
 Note that the mathematical definition of maximum cycle mean and maximum profit
 to cost are different, though some time the name "maximum cycle mean" is used to
 refer to the maximum profit to cost ratio.
 <p>
 For a detailed mathematical description of the problem, refer to:

 cycle mean and optimum cost to time ratio problems,
