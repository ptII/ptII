/**
 A base class for analyses on graphs.
 <p>
 The organization of the package follows:
 <p>
 Classes in ptolemy.graph.analysis consists of different wrappers in
 which a client can plug a requested strategy/algorithm for an analysis.
 Strategies for a given analysis implement the same interface defined
 in ptolemy.graph.analysis.analyzer.
 Therefore from now on we will use the name analyzer for all the strategies
 that implement the same interface and therefore  solve the same problem.
 Analysis classes access the plugged-in strategy class through these interfaces.
 <p>
 In the base class methods are provided in order to dynamically change the
 analyzer of the current analysis and also to check if a given analyzer is
 applicable to the given analysis.
 <p>
 Analyzers that can be used in these analyses are a specialized version of
 analyzers called {@link ptolemy.graph.analysis.analyzer.GraphAnalyzer}.
 <p>
 Classes in ptolemy.graph.analysis.analyzer are the interfaces for
 different strategies(algorithms) used for the analysis. The strategies classes
 are defined in ptolemy.graph.analysis.strategy
 <p>
 In addition, the analysis classes provide default constructors which use
 predefined strategies for those clients who do not want to deal with different
 strategies.
 Although this introduces some limitations imposed by the used strategy. The
 documentation of such constructor will reflect the limitations, if any.
 <p>
 Finally, strategies can be instantiated and used independently. In this case
 the client will lose the possibility of dynamically changing the analyzer for
 the associated analysis, which would not exist at all, and there will be no
 default constructor therefore the client need to be familiar with the strategy
 that she/he is using.
