/**
 Analysis to check if a cyclic directed graph has a negative-length cycle.
 A negative-length cycle is a cycle in which the sum of all the values associated
 with the edges of the cycle is negative. In a graph with multiple edges between
 two nodes the one with the smallest associated value is being used to check for
 the existence of negative cycles.
