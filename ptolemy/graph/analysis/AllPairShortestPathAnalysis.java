/**
 An analysis to compute of the all pair shortest path of a directed graph.
 The result is in the form of two dimensional array (matrix).
 The first dimension is indexed by the source node label while the second one is
 indexed by the sink node label. In graphs that have multiple edges between two
 nodes obviously the edge with the minimum weight is being considered for
 the shortest path.
 <p>
 The distance between a node and itself is being considered Double.MAX_VALUE,
 unless there is a self-edge.
 <p>
 The result of {@link #shortestPathMatrix()}[i][i] would be the
 length of the shortest cycle that includes the node with label "i".
 <p>

 The default analyzer runs in O(N^3) in which N is the number of nodes.
