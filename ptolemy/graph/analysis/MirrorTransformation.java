/**
 A mirror transformations on graphs. Creates a mirror of this graph
 in the form of the type of the associated graph.  The mirror and
 original graphs are isomorphic(of same topology). However, node and
 edge objects of the mirror are newly created and therefore not
 "equal" to those of the original graph.
 <p>
 To relate nodes and edges from the original and the mirrored graph
 the {@link #transformedVersionOf} and {@link #originalVersionOf} methods are
 provided.
 Labels can also be used to relate mirror and original
 nodes(edges).
 <p>
 In the {@link #cloneWeight} method, users can also specify whether
 to clone node and edge weights. For non cloneable weights a {@link
 java.lang.CloneNotSupportedException} will be thrown by the virtual
 machine.
