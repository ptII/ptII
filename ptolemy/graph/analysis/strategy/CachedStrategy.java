/**
 A base class for cached analyzers on graphs. To facilitate demand-driven
 and incremental recomputation (e.g., see [1]) of analyzers, analyzer results
 are cached internally (see {@link #getCachedResult()}), and are recomputed only
 when the graph has changed since the last request (via {@link #_result()}) for
 the strategy result.
 The status of the cache content can be queried with the {@link #obsolete()}
 method to determine if a subsequent invocation of {@link #_result()} by the
 derived classes will trigger recomputation of the analysis.
 <p>
 The graph changes tracked by an analyzer are restricted to changes in the
 graph topology (the set of nodes and edges). For example, changes to edge/node
 weights that may affect the result of an analysis are not tracked, since
 analyzers have no specific knowledge of weights.  In such cases, it is the
 responsibility of the client (or derived analyzer class) to invalidate the
 cached result (see {@link #reset()}) when changes to graph weights or other
 non-topology information render the cached result obsolete.  For this reason,
 some caution is generally required when using analyzers whose results depend on
 more than just the graph topology.<p>
 In these cases the client should check for data consistency
 (through the {@link #valid()} method) as well as changes in them and
 calling the {@link #reset()} method in case of data changes.
