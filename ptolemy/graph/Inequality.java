/**
 An inequality over a CPO.
 Each inequality consists of two <code>InequalityTerms</code>, the lesser
 term and the greater term. The relation between them is <i>less than or
 equal to</i>.  In addition, an inequality keeps a list of variables in it.
 The variables are <code>InequalityTerms</code> that consist of a single
 variable.
