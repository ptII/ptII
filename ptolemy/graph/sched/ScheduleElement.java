//// ScheduleElement

/**
 This is an abstract base class for a schedule element. Instances of the
 Schedule and Firing subclasses are used to construct a schedule(static or
 dynamic).
 A Schedule can be thought of as a structure that consists of an iteration
 count and a list of ScheduleElements. A ScheduleElement can be a
 Firing, or another Schedule. It is usually required that,
 all of the lowest-level ScheduleElements are Firings. It is
 up to the scheduler to enforce this, however. The Schedule class is a
 ScheduleElement that is a schedule. Schedules are created by schedule analyses.
 The Firing class is a ScheduleElement that contains a Firing element. Therefore,
 the top-level ScheduleElement must be an instance of Schedule, and all
 of the lowest-level elements must each be instances of Firing.
 <p>
 This base class implements the getIterationCount() and setIterationCount()
 methods, which return and set the iteration count for this schedule element.
 A default value of 1 is used for the iteration count.
