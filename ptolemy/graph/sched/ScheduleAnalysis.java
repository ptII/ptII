/**
 An analysis for schedules on graphs. The analyzer associate with this analysis
 which is supposed to implement the ScheduleAnalyzer interface generates a
 Schedule for a given Graph. The analyzer that for a given implementation would
 extend the Strategy ( or CachedStrategy) class contains the scheduling
 algorithm. Scheduling strategies can be dynamically changed, therefore dynamic
 schedulings are also supported.
