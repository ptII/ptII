//// Firing

/**
 This class is a ScheduleElement that contains a reference to a
 firing element.  The firingElement could be any Object.
 This class is used together with the Schedule class to
 construct a Schedule. The setFiringElement() method is used to create the
 reference to a firing element. The getFiringElement() method will return a
 reference to this firing element.
 <p>

 It is more efficient to use this class than to simply maintain a list of
 firing elements since firing elements will often firing multiple times
 consecutively.  Using
 this class (and the Schedule data structure in general) greatly reduces the
 memory requirements of most large schedules.
