/**
 An optionally-weighted node for an undirected or directed graph.  More
 specifically, a node consists of an optional <i>weight</i> (an arbitrary
 object that is associated with the node).  We say that a node is
 <i>unweighted</i> if it does not have an assigned weight. It is an error to
 attempt to access the weight of an unweighted node. Node weights must be
 genuine (non-null) objects.
