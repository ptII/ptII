/**
 A base class for graph elements (nodes and edges).
 A graph element consists of an optional <i>weight</i> (an arbitrary
 object that is associated with the element).  We say that an element is
 <i>unweighted</i> if it does not have an assigned weight. It is an error to
 attempt to access the weight of an unweighted element. Element weights must
 be non-null objects.
