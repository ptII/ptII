/** A mapping from some domain of values into some range.
 Mappings are different from Maps (see {@link java.util.List}) in that the set
 of keys (domain values) is not necessarily stored with or even known to a
 Mapping.  Enumeration of or iteration through the domain values is thus not in
 general possible.
 <p>
 This is a base interface for specific mappings. For efficiency, the derived
 mappings should define their own methods to actually perform the associated
 mapping function. These methods can thus be specialized, for example, to return
 the desired return type (rather than an Object). Also, derived Mappings
 may choose, again for efficiency reasons, to forego any error-checking
 in the methods that implement their mapping functions (i.e, they may
 assume that the arguments are in the corresponding domains). In such cases,
 the {@link #inDomain(Object)} method can be used when it is desired
 to make sure that that a candidate argument is in the domain.
