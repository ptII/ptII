/**
 An interface defining the operations on complete partial order (CPO).
 The definitions of these operations can be found in "Introduction to
 Lattices and Order," Cambridge University Press, 1990, by B. A. Davey
 and H. A. Priestley. Informal definitions are given in the code comments.

 Each element in the CPO is represented by an Object.
 For infinite CPOs, the result of some of the operations may be an
 infinite set, in which case, the class implementing those operations
 can throw an Exception.
