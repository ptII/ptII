/**
 A weighted or unweighted edge for a directed or undirected graph.  The
 connectivity of edges is specified by <i>source</i> nodes and <i>sink</i>
 nodes. A directed edge is directed <i>from</i> its source node <i>to</i> its
 sink node. For an undirected edge, the source node is simply the first node
 that was specified when the edge was created, and the sink node is the
 second node.  This convention allows undirected edges to later be converted
 in a consistent manner to directed edges, if desired.

 <p>On creation of an edge, an arbitrary object can be associated with the
 edge as the weight of the edge.  We say that an edge is <i>unweighted</i> if
 it does not have an assigned weight. It is an error to attempt to access the
 weight of an unweighted edge.

 <p>Self-loop edges (edges whose source and sink nodes are identical)
 are allowed.

 <p> Once an edge is created, its source node and sink node cannot be changed.
