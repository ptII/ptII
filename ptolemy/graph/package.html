Algorithms for manipulation and analyzing mathematical graphs.
These algorithms support scheduling and analysis of Ptolemy II models.
<p>Documentation for the ptolemy.graph package may be found in
Volume 2 of the Ptolemy Design Document, available at
<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/designdoc.htm">http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/designdoc.htm</a>.
<p>Significant portions of the <code>ptolemy.graph</code> package were developed
by <a href="http://www.ece.umd.edu/~ssb/">Professor Shuvra S. Bhattacharyya</a> and his group.
