/**
 A graph with optionally-weighted nodes and edges.

 <p>Each node or edge may have a weight associated with it
 (see {@link Edge} and {@link Node}).
 The nodes (edges) in a graph are always distinct, but their weights
 need not be.

 <p>Each node (edge) has a unique, integer label associated with it.
 These labels can be used, for example, to index arrays and matrixes
 whose rows/columns correspond to nodes (edges). See {@link #nodeLabel(Node)}
 ({@link #edgeLabel(Edge)}) for details.

 <p>Both directed and undirected graphs can be implemented using this
 class. In directed graphs, the order of nodes specified to the
 <code>addEdge</code> method is relevant, whereas in undirected graphs, the
 order is unimportant. Support for both undirected and directed graphs
 follows from the combined support for these in the underlying {@link
 Node} and {@link Edge} classes. For more thorough support for directed
 graphs, see {@link DirectedGraph}.

 <p>The same node can exist in multiple graphs, but any given graph can
 contain only one instance of the node. Node labels, however, are local to
 individual graphs. Thus, the same node may have different labels in different
 graphs.
 Furthermore, the label assigned in a given graph to a node may change over
 time (if the set of nodes in the graph changes). If a node is contained in
 multiple graphs, it has the same weight in all of the graphs.
 All of this holds for edges
 as well. The same weight may be shared among multiple nodes and edges.

 <p> Multiple edges in a graph can connect the same pair of nodes.
 Thus, multigraphs are supported.

 <p>Once assigned, node and edge weights should not be changed in ways that
 affect comparison under the <code>equals</code> method.
 Otherwise, unpredictable behavior may result.

 <p>In discussions of complexity, <em>n</em> and <em>e</em> refers to the
 number of graph nodes and edges, respectively.

 <p>In derived classes, the following methods need special
 attention regarding whether or not they should be overridden:
