/**
 The class of checkpoint objects. A checkpoint object represents the smallest
 entity on which checkpoints are created and managed. It monitors one or more
 objects. When the {@link #rollback(long, boolean)} function is called, all
 the monitored objects are rolled back to their previous states, defined by a
 <em>timestamp</em>.
