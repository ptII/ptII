//// CheckpointState

/**
 The current state of a checkpoint object. A checkpoint object stores its
 complete state in its <tt>CheckpointState</tt> object. Different checkpoint
 objects may share the same state, and hence they represent the same
 checkpoint entity.
 <p>
 When two checkpoint objects are merged, they exchange their states and
 compute the union of the two.
