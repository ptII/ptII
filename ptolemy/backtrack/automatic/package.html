This package contains the automatically generated backtracking
versions of Ptolemy actors. For each actor listed in 
<a ref="source.lst">source.lst</a>, a backtracking version is generated
and placed in the "ptolemy" sub-directory. These actors have the same
functionality as the original ones, and their states can be rolled
back with the checkpointing mechanism.

    @since Ptolemy II 6.1
