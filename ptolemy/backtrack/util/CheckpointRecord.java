/**
 Record for checkpoint objects. Each {@link Rollbackable} is monitored by a
 checkpoint object at a time. The {@link Rollbackable} object maintains a
 record for its checkpoint objects. When a new checkpoint object is assigned,
 the old one is pushed to the checkpoint record. When a rollback is issued
 beyond the time when the last checkpoint object was assigned, the previous
 checkpoint object is then assigned back to the {@link Rollbackable}.
 <p>
 This record for checkpoint objects is basically a stack, with the top
 element as the last assigned checkpoint object (the checkpoint object that
 currently monitors a {@link Rollbackable}).
