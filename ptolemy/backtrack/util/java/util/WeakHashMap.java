/** 
 * A weak hash map has only weak references to the key. This means that it
 * allows the key to be garbage collected if it is not used otherwise. If
 * this happens, the entry will eventually disappear from the map,
 * asynchronously.
 * <p>A weak hash map makes most sense when the keys doesn't override the
 * <code>equals</code> method: If there is no other reference to the
 * key nobody can ever look up the key in this table and so the entry
 * can be removed.  This table also works when the <code>equals</code>
 * method is overloaded, such as String keys, but you should be prepared
 * to deal with some entries disappearing spontaneously.
 * <p>Other strange behaviors to be aware of: The size of this map may
 * spontaneously shrink (even if you use a synchronized map and synchronize
 * it); it behaves as if another thread removes entries from this table
 * without synchronization.  The entry set returned by <code>entrySet</code>
 * has similar phenomenons: The size may spontaneously shrink, or an
 * entry, that was in the set before, suddenly disappears.
 * <p>A weak hash map is not meant for caches; use a normal map, with
 * soft references as values instead, or try {
@link LinkedHashMap}
.
 * <p>The weak hash map supports null values and null keys.  The null key
 * is never deleted from the map (except explictly of course). The
 * performance of the methods are similar to that of a hash map.
 * <p>The value objects are strongly referenced by this table.  So if a
 * value object maintains a strong reference to the key (either direct
 * or indirect) the key will never be removed from this map.  According
 * to Sun, this problem may be fixed in a future release.  It is not
 * possible to do it with the jdk 1.2 reference model, though.
