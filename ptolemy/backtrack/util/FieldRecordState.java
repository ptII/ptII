/**
 The state of a field record. A field record records the changes in a field.
 Each {@link Rollbackable} object may have 0 or more field records. The
 information of a field record is kept in a field record state. When a new
 checkpoint object is assigned to the {@link Rollbackable} object, its
 previous field record states are pushed on to stacks, and new states are
 allocated. When the previous checkpoint object is restored to the {@link
 Rollbackable} object, the previous field record states are popped out.
