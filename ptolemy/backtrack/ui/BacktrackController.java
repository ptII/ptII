/**
 Backtracking controller for composite actors. This controller is built on top
 of the backtracking sub-system. It helps to create checkpoints for Ptolemy II
 composite actors. Each of those checkpoints may correspond to multiple
 checkpoints in the backtracking sub-system, due to the fact that entities in
 a composite actor may be monitored by different checkpoint objects. This
 controller also allows to roll back the composite actor to its previous
 state.
