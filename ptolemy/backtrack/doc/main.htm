<h1>Backtracking</h1>
<P>
Backtracking mechanism allows to record the execution state of the model, and
roll back to a record state later in the execution.
<P>
An incremental checkpointing technique is used for backtracking. It requires to
record only the state changes during the execution, but not the complete state
(also known as snapshot) of the whole model. Actors to be backtracked must be
transformed with the Ptolemy backtracking transformer. The models that uses
these actors acquire the ability to record their states in checkpoints, and
later to roll back to those checkpoints.
