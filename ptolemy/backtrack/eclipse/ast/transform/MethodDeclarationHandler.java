//// MethodDeclarationHandler

/**
 Interface of the method handlers called by {@link TypeAnalyzer}.
 Users may register method handlers (and other kinds of supported
 handlers) to the {@link TypeAnalyzer} used to analyze Java source code.
 When the analyzer detects a method declaration, it calls back those
 method handlers before and after proper types are assigned to all the
 arguments.
 <p>
 {@link #exit(MethodDeclaration, TypeAnalyzerState)} of method handlers are
 allowed to modify the method declaration, either by modifying its children
 in the AST, or by replacing the whole method declaration with another valid
 AST node. This is because the handler is called after the subtree rooted at
 the method declaration is completely visited by the analyzer. However,
 modifying any node out of this subtree (e.g., changing the parent of this
 method declaration to another one) may cause unexpected effect.
 <p>
 {@link #enter(MethodDeclaration, TypeAnalyzerState)} should not modify the
 method declaration.
