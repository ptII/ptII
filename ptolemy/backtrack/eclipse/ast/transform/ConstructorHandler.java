/**
 Interface of the constructor handlers called by {@link TypeAnalyzer}.
 Users may register constructor handlers (and other kinds of supported
 handlers) to the {@link TypeAnalyzer} used to analyze Java source code.
 When the analyzer detects a constructor declaration or a call to a
 constructor, it calls back those constructor handlers after proper types are
 assigned to all the arguments.
 <p>
 Constructor handlers are allowed to modify the constructor, either by
 modifying its children in the AST, or by replacing the whole constructor
 with another valid AST node. This is because the handler is called after the
 subtree rooted at the constructor is completely visited by the analyzer.
 However, modifying any node out of this subtree (e.g., changing the parent
 of this constructor to another one) may cause unexpected effect.
