/**
 Transformation rule to be executed by {@link TypeAnalyzer} while it
 traverses the program AST.
 <p>
 This type of source ransformation is specified with rules, each of
 which defines the actions to be executed <em>before</em> the traversal
 and <em>after</em> the traversal. Implementation of a rule may add
 special handlers ({@link AssignmentHandler}, {@link ClassHandler}, etc.)
 to the analyzer before the traversal, and finalize its transformation
 after the traversal.
