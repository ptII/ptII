/**
 Interface of the assignment handlers called by {@link TypeAnalyzer}.
 Users may register assignment handlers (and other kinds of supported
 handlers) to the {@link TypeAnalyzer} used to analyze Java source code.
 When the analyzer detects an assignment, it calls back those assignment
 handlers after proper types are assigned to both the left-hand side and
 the right-hand side of the assignment.
 <p>
 Assignment handlers are allowed to modify the assignment, either by
 modifying its children in the AST, or by replacing the whole assignment
 with another expression. This is because the handler is called after the
 subtree rooted at the assignment is completely visited by the analyzer.
 However, modifying any node out of this subtree (e.g., changing the parent
 of this assignment to another one) may cause unexpected effect.
