/**
 Interface of the cross-analysis handlers called by {@link TypeAnalyzer}.
 Users may register cross-analysis handlers (and other kinds of supported
 handlers) to the {@link TypeAnalyzer} used to analyze Java source code.
 When the analyzer detects more cross-analyzed types, it calls back those
 cross-analysis.
 <p>
 Cross-analyzed types are the other types to be refactored at the same time.
 Special care is taken about those types because their instances are
 monitored by checkpoint objects. It is not possible to know all the
 cross-analyzed types at the beginning of the refactoring. It is then
 necessary to fix the refactoring result whenever more cross-analyzed types
 are found as the type analysis goes on.
