//// FieldDeclarationHandler

/**
 Interface of the field handlers called by {@link TypeAnalyzer}.
 Users may register field handlers (and other kinds of supported
 handlers) to the {@link TypeAnalyzer} used to analyze Java source code.
 When the analyzer detects a field declaration, it calls back those
 field handlers before and after proper types are assigned to all the
 arguments.
 <p>
 {@link #exit(FieldDeclaration, TypeAnalyzerState)} of field handlers are
 allowed to modify the field declaration, either by modifying its children
 in the AST, or by replacing the whole field declaration with another valid
 AST node. This is because the handler is called after the subtree rooted at
 the field declaration is completely visited by the analyzer. However,
 modifying any node out of this subtree (e.g., changing the parent of this
 field declaration to another one) may cause unexpected effect.
 <p>
 {@link #enter(FieldDeclaration, TypeAnalyzerState)} should not modify the
 field declaration.
