/**
 Interface of the class declaration handlers called by {@link TypeAnalyzer}.
 Users may register class declaration handlers (and other kinds of supported
 handlers) to the {@link TypeAnalyzer} used to analyze Java source code.
 When the analyzer detects a class declaration, it calls back those
 handlers after the classes are completely traversed.
 <p>
 Class declaration handlers are allowed to modify the classes.
