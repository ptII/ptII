 Thrown on an attempt to load a class that cannot be found in the class
 path, or a class that is not properly imported. It is caused only in AST
 analysis and manipulation procedures. Because those procedures are not
 explicitly declared to raise exceptions in the superclasses, this
 exception is a descendant of {@link RuntimeException}.
