//// ASTResolutionException

/**
 Thrown when a name in a source program cannot be resolved. When {@link
 TypeAnalyzer} analyzes a Java program, it tries to assign a type to each
 (sub)expression, each method call, each field, and each local variable.
 If an appropriate type cannot be found, this exception is raised.
 <p>
 Because AST functions are not declared to raise exceptions, this exception
 is designed to be a descendant of {@link RuntimeException}.
