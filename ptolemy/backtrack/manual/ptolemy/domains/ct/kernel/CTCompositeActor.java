/**
 Composite actor that supports backtracking in the CT domain.
 <p>
 This composite actor records the state of all the actors (atomic or
 composite) in it when requested by the Continuous-Time (CT) director. The
 CT director may request a rollback to the previous state later.
 <p>
 As a property of CT, only one-level backtracking is needed. This means the
 previous states of the actors earlier than the last state can be safely
 discarded.
