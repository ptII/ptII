//// Backtrack
/**
 This actor provides the interface to the backtracking mechanism. It is able to
 create checkpoints (in which case a checkpoint handle is returned) and roll
 back to previously created checkpoints.

 This actor has a "checkpoint" input port. It takes a boolean token in every
 firing, which means whether a checkpoint should be created. If it is true, a
 checkpoint will be created in the firing, and the checkpoint handle (a long
 number) will be output to the "handle" output port; otherwise, no output value
 will be sent to the "handle" port. The "rollback" input port takes a checkpoint
 handle (a long number) in each firing. If the handle is greater than 0, a
 rollback operation will be performed, and the whole model, including its
 hierarchical components if any, restores its previous state recorded for that
 checkpoint; if the given checkpoint handle is equal to or less than 0, the
 rollback operation will not be performed.
