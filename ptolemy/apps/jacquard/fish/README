COMPILING AND RUNNING

  Base sequential implementation:
    fish/sequential
  Primary parallel implementations:
    fish/mpi
    fish/pthreads
    fish/openmp

To compile the code, use a sequence like the following:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../configure
  make

This will leave the source untouched and place executables
in appropriate directories under build/.

Run
  sequential/fish -h
to see the basic options all programs take.  The pthreads
program takes an additional -p option to specify the number 
of threads.

Use batch scripts or interactive batch mode for running the MPI,
OpenMP, and pthreads versions.  Note that there are only 2 processors
per node in Jacquard, but there are 8 processors per node in
Bassi.

To see the "fish":

  mpirun -np 4 build/mpi/fish -o fishies
  ./aquarium fishies

This should work on Jacquard, if you have X forwarding setup.  You may need
to use the '-Y' option with ssh.


OpenMP uses an environment variable to set the number of
processors.  For four threads, use
  env OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 build/openmp/fish

Good luck, and let me know of the inevitable bugs.
