/**
 * This director implements the Ptides (= Programming Temporally Integrated
 * Distributed Systems) model of computation. It executes actors according to
 * event time stamps. The difference to the DE director is that events can be
 * executed out of time stamped order.
 * <p>
 * Composite actors using this director can contain sensors, actuators,
 * computation actors with worst case execution times and model time delay
 * actors. The execution of these actors is governed by this director. Some of
 * these actors require a that the model time when an actor is fired is
 * equal to the physical time. The model time is defined by the event time stamp
 * that is responsible for firing the actor, the physical time is defined by the model time of the
 * executive director. Actors that require this mapping of model time to real time are sensors and
 * actuators. This mapping is also required to simulate the execution of actors
 * with a worst case execution time > 0.
 * <p>
 * Executing actors in platforms is done according to their model time stamps.
 * The execution does not have to be in time stamp order, the only
 * requirement is that events on ports in the same equivalence class
 * (@see CausalityInterface.equivalentPorts()) are processed in
 * time stamped order. To satisfy this requirement, an analysis on events is
 * used to determine whether they are safe to process. For this analysis, the
 * causality interface and the RealDependency - link - between ports are used.
 * <p>
 * This director executes actors in an infinite loop. At every iteration in the
 * loop, a set of all events is selected that are safe to process. Out of this
 * set of events, one event is selected to be processed. This selection is done
 * by the PlatformExecutionStrategy - link - which takes into account platform
 * characteristics like preemption and priorities. The firing of an actor is
 * divided into two steps, a start and a terminate. At the start of a firing, an
 * actor is put into a list of actors currently executing. If the actor has a
 * worst case execution time > 0, the platform schedules a refiring for the
 * current physical time + WCET by calling the fireAt() of the enclosing
 * director. When the WCET passed, the actor is taken out of the list of actors
 * currently in execution in the second step of the firing. If another actor
 * should be fired in the meantime, it preempts the currently executing actor
 * thus is also added to the list of actors in execution and the finishing times
 * of those actors are adjusted. When using a platform
 * execution strategy that does not support preemption, this list will have at
 * most one entry. The actual firing of an actor is done either at the start or
 * the termination time. This depends on whether the WCET is a static property
 * of the actor or it is only known after firing the actor. E.g. actors that
 * require simulation to determine the WCET such as TDLModules have to be fired
 * at the beginning of the execution.
 *
 * TODO: currently, this director only supports fixed priorities; e.g. actor a
 * preempts b and then b preempts a would not work.
 * <p>
 * Events are not maintained by a single event queue. There are two types of
 * events used in this domain: regular events and pure events. A regular event
 * is a combination of time stamp and value sent from the output port of one
 * actor to the input port of another actor. A pure event is a time stamp
 * that schedules firing an actor, there is no connection to any value or
 * input port. Regular events
 * are stored in the receivers as pairs of timestamp and value. For the pure events
 * for every actor, a list is created that saves time stamps of pure events for
 * that actor.
 *
 * <p>
 * This director is used to simulate the execution of actors, thus actors might define
 * execution times. Some actors will define worst case execution times, for other actors
 * a real execution time might be determined by simulating the actor and thus deriving
 * the execution time.
