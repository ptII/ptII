attached is a Ptolemy model of an automotive engine. It has three main
components: the engine dynamics, the catalytic converter  and the
controller. I checked the file and it works well, however let me know
if there is any problem to open or run it. Unfortunately I do not have
a file with the definition of the variables, however, most of them have
descriptive names. Hope it helps.
