ModalControl.xml

The controller in this model implements a H-infinity controller, designed
by Subhabrata Ganguli for decoupled tracking of angle of climb and velocity
for a B737 a/c, in an environment of fluctuating cpu time.

The controller switches to lower order (13) controller at Tfault1 sec and
switches back to higher order (18) at time Tfault2 sec. The status component
in the model outputs 0 when Tfault1 < time < Tfault2, 1 otherwise. It can
be elaborated to model realistic cpu monitoring schemes.

FullOrderControl.xml

The controller is always higher order.

CompareControllers.xml

Run two instances of the plant, one under modal control, one under full
order control.

To run the model, start Vergil in this directory (FIXME).

reference_plot.jpg contains the results produced by the matlab model from
Raktim. The other jpg files contain plots generated by the Ptolemy models.
These models are very slow.
