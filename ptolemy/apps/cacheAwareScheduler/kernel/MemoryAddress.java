////MemoryAddress

/**

 This class represents a memory address for data produced and consumed by
 SDF actors. It is primarily used by cache aware scheduler during schedule
 generation.

 This class doesn't have any member functions, its simply a collection of
 two data items namely the actor id that produced this data and the
 index of the produced token.
