<h1>Query Widget</h1>
<p>
The Query class in the ptolemy.gui package provides a very simple interface
for creating on-screen controls for parameter values.  The controls
include entry boxes, check boxes, and sliders. Below is an example that
includes one of each type of query that is supported.  Such
a combination of queries is not particularly attractive, and
is rarely needed, but it illustrates the features.
<center>
<p>

        <applet 
             code = "ptolemy.gui.demo.QueryApplet" codebase = "../../.." archive = "ptolemy/ptsupport.jar" width = "400" height = "250" 
            > 
            <param name="name" value="Query" > 
	    <param name="background" value="#ffffff" > 
            <BR><I>If you were able to run applets, you would have one here.</I> 
<BR> 
        </applet> 
</center>
Notice that if you change the values, the change is reported
in the status bar of the browser.
See the <a href="QueryApplet.java">source code</a> to
see how to create a widget like this.
<p>
An instance of Query can be placed in a modal dialog using
the <a href="../../../doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/gui/ComponentDialog.html">ComponentDialog</a>
class.
