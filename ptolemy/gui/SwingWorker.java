/**
 This is the 3rd version of SwingWorker (also known as
 SwingWorker 3), an abstract class that you subclass to
 perform GUI-related work in a dedicated thread.  For
 instructions on using this class, see:

 <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/threads.html">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/threads.html</a>

 Note that the API changed slightly in the 3rd version:
 You must now invoke start() on the SwingWorker after
 creating it.
