<h1>License for the ptolemy/gui/ExtensionFileFilter.java</h1>
<p>ptolemy/gui/ExtensionFileFilter.java is used by
ptolemy/gui/PtolemyFrame.java and ptolemy/actor/gui/TableauFrame.java.
This class is a copy of diva.gui.ExtensionFileFilter so that
ptolemy.gui does not require diva.</p>

<p>Note that as of Java 1.6, there is a FileNameExtensionFilter which
replaces this class.  See
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/filechooser/FileNameExtensionFilter.html">http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/filechooser/FileNameExtensionFilter.html</a>
However, this class can be used with both java.awt.FileDialog
and javax.swing.JFileChooser because it implements java.io.FilenameFilter
and extends javax.swing.FilenameFilter.</p>
