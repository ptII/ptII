/**
 Code generator helper associated with the PtidesTopLevelDirector class.
 This helper generates Luminary specific code.

 This director starts a task for each actor. Each task has a specified
 name, stack size, priority and function code to execute. User can introduce
 annotations in an actor to specify these values. In particular, this
 helper class looks for the "_stackSize" and "_priority" parameters and
 use their values to create the tasks. If these parameters are not specified,
 the code generator uses the default value 80 for stack size, and 0 for
 priority.

 Each task executes a given function which consists of the actor initialization,
 fire and wrapup code.
