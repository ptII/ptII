//// SyntacticContraction

/**
 This class represents a contraction operator in the SyntacticTerm
 language. It represents the operation of contracting a SyntacticTerm
 with <b>m</b> inputs and <b>n</b> outputs along the first <b>k</b>
 of each, where <b>k</b> is a parameter of the operator called
 <i>degree</i> in the class. The result is a term (as an interface)
 with <b>m-k</b> inputs and <b>n-k</b> outputs. The operand term being
 contracted is the <i>kernel</i> of the operator and is referred to
 by the class as such.

 The initial object, without a kernel, can be understood to be an
 operator. Once the kernel is set, the object can be reasonably
 treated as a syntactic term representing the operator acting on
 the kernel.
