/**
 This class represents a named SyntacticTerm. It could be either a
 a bound name referring to another term, possibly an expression, 
 or a SyntacticNode. These terms are the leaves of the expression 
 tree created using SyntacticTerm expression constructs. This mechanism
 could also be used for recursion, although this idea has not been 
 completely worked out.
