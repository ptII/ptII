//// SyntacticSeries

/**
 This class represents a series composition over a sequence of SyntacticTerms.
 Each term in the sequence is composed with the previous to form a chain 
 of operations. Each output is connected in order with each input of the 
 subsequent term. The term produced by this composition has a number of inputs
 equal to that of the first term in the sequence, and a number of outputs
 equal to that of the last term. 
 
 The chain is initialized as empty, and terms can be added to it either 
 pushing to the end, or by insertion. In these operations, checking is done
 to enforce the constraint that the number of inputs and outputs are equal
 at a composition. Removal is possible, although only when a term is has the 
 same number of inputs as outputs.
