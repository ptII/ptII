//// Implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem.

/**
 Five philosophers are seated at a table with a large bowl of food in
 the middle. Between each pair of philosophers is one chopstick, and to
 eat a philosopher must use both chopsticks beside him. Each philosopher
 spends his life in the following cycle: He thinks for a while, gets hungry,
 picks up one of the chopsticks beside him, then the other, eats for a
 while and puts the chopsticks down on the table again. If a philosopher
 tries to grab a chopstick  but it is already being used by another
 philosopher, then the philosopher waits until that chopstick becomes
 available. This implies that no neighbouring philosophers can eat at the
 same time and at most two philosophers can eat at a time.
 <p>
 The Dining Philosophers problem was first dreamt up by Edsger W. Dijkstra
 in 1965. It is a classic concurrent programming problem that illustrates
 the two basic properties of concurrent programming:
 <LI>
 <B>Liveness</B>. How can we design the program to avoid deadlock, where
 none of the the philosophers can make progress because each is waiting
 for someone else to do something?
 <LI>
 <B>Fairness</B>. How can we design the program to avoid starvation, where
 one of the philosoph ers could make progress but does not because others
 always go first?
 <p>
 This demo uses an algorithm that lets each philosopher randomly chose
 which chopstick to pick up first, and all philosophers eat and think at the
 same rates. This algorithm is fair as any time a chopstick is not being used
 and both philosophers try to use it, they both have an equal chance of
 succeeding. However this algorithm does not guarantee the absence of
 deadlock, and if it is let run long enough this will eventually occur.
 The probability that deadlock occurs sooner increases as he thinking
 times are decreased relative to the eating times.
