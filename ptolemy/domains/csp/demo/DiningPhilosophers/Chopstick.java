//// Chopstick

/**
 Chopstick in the Dining Philosophers demo. Each Chopstick can only be
 used by one philosopher at a time. When it is not being used it can be
 claimed by either of the two philosophers next to it. Once it has been
 claimed, it is not available until it is released by the philosopher
 holding it.
 <p>
 This actor has four ports, each of width one: two are used to communicate
 with the philosopher on the left, and two are used to communicate with
 the buffer on the right. Two ports are needed to communicate with each
 philosopher as the philosopher holds the chopstick for some random time.
