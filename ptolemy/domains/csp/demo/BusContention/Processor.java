/**
 A CSP actor that contends for a shared resource. A Processor actor
 is granted access to the shared resource via a Controller actor.
 The processor must connect to a Controller via its requestInput
 and requestOutput ports. The shared resource that the Processor
 attempts to gain access to is a Memory actor. The memory actor
 is connected to via the Processor's memoryInput and memoryOutput
 ports.

 The Processor actor has four informal states. In state one it
 determines at what time it will next attempt to access the
 shared resource. It will then place a request at the determined
 time. In state two, it will wait to see if it has been granted
 the request. The Processor enters state three if it is granted
 the request. It remains in state three for 300 milliseconds,
 accesses the shared resource and then returns to state two. If
 the Processor is denied its request, then it enters four and
 remains in that state for 300 milliseconds after which it returns
 to state four.

 In addition to the resource contention features of Processor,
 it can also notify an ExecEventListener as this actor jumps between
 its three states. Such notification is enabled by adding an
 ExecEventListener to this actor's listener list via the addListeners()
 method. Listeners can be removed via the removeListeners() method.
 ExecEventListeners are currently implemented to serve as conduits
 between Ptolemy II and the Diva graphical user interface.
