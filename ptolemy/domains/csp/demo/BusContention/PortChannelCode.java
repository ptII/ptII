/**
 A PortChannelCode is an object that carries prioritization information
 to be associated with different contenders in a resource contention
 scheme. A PortChannelCode consists of three components as its name
 implies and each instance of PortChannelCode is associated with a
 single resource contender. The port (channel) value represents the
 port (channel) through which a particular contender is connected. The
 code value represents the priority assigned to the contender.
