/**
 An event that indicates that an actor is in a particular state.
 The event contains two pieces of information:  the actor that
 generated the event and the (integer) state of the actor when
 the event was generated. A class that listens for ExecEvents
 must implement the ExecEventListener interface.

 The interpretation of state is determined by the actors and
 listeners that use the ExecEvent class and ExecEventListener
 interface. The author of code that takes advantage of these
 facilities should write the actors and listeners so that they
 utilize a common meaning for the integer states.
