/**
 A ContentionAlarm is a CSP actor that creates an output only after
 timed deadlock has been reached by all other CSP actors in the
 containing composite actor. A ContentionAlarm has one input and
 one output port as well as three "informal" states. During the
 fire() method, the actor is enabled to cycle through each of the
 three states.

 In state one, the ContentionAlarm attempts to receive a token through
 its input port. Once a token has been received, the actor enters state
 two and calls the _waitForDeadlock() method that it inherits from
 CSPActor. This method means that the actor becomes time delayed and
 will not continue until all other actors in the composite actor are
 either blocked or time delayed. Once _waitForDeadlock() returns, the
 actor enters state three and sends a token through its output port.

 A useful application of ContentionAlarm is to notify other actors
 if there are multiple contenders for a given resource at a given
 time. Because of the semantics of _waitForDeadlock(), ContentionAlarm
 will not "wake up" until all contenders have attempted to access a
 particular resource.

 In addition to the time delay oriented semantics of ContentionAlarm,
 it can also notify an ExecEventListener as this actor jumps between
 its three states. Such notification is enabled by adding an
 ExecEventListener to this actor's listener list via the addListeners()
 method. Listeners can be removed via the removeListeners() method.
 ExecEventListeners are currently implemented to serve as conduits
 between Ptolemy II and the Diva graphical user interface.
