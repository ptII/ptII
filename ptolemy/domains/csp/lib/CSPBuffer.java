/**
 A single channel buffer. This actor is the canonical example of how
 to use a CDO construct. It is parameterized by the Parameter "depth",
 which controls how many Tokens can be stored in this buffer.
 The default depth of the buffer is 1. The buffer depth is set upon
 calling the fire method. The fire() method does not return until a
 TerminateProcessException is thrown.
