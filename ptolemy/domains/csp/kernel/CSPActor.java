/**
 This class is the base class of all atomic actors using the
 non-deterministic communication and timed features of  the communicating
 sequential processes(CSP) domain.
 <p>
 Two conditional communication constructs are available: "Conditional if"
 (CIF) and "Conditional do" (CDO). The constructs are analogous to,
 but different from, the common <I>if</I> and <I>do</I> statements. The
 steps involved in using both of these are
 <BR>(1) create the branches involved and assign an identification number
 to each branch.
 <BR>(2) call the chooseBranch() method, which invokes the chooseBranch()
 method of the controller to determine which branch should succeed.
 <BR>(3) execute the statements associated with the successful branch.
 <P>
 Each branch is either an instance of ConditionalSend or ConditionalReceive,
 depending on the communication in the branch. Please see these classes for
 details on <I>guarded communication statements</I>, which they represent.
 The identification number assigned to each branch only needs to identify
 the branch uniquely for one sequence of the steps above. A good example
 of how to use a CDO is the code in the actor CSPBuffer, in the
 ptolemy.domains.csp.lib package. One significant difference between a
 CDO (or CIF) and a common <I>do</I> (<I>if</I>) is that all the branches
 are evaluated in parallel, as opposed to sequentially.

 <p>The chooseBranch() method takes an array of the branches as an
 argument, and simply passes the branches to the chooseBranch() method
 of the controller to decide which branch is successful. The successful
 branch is the branch that succeeds with its communication. See the
 chooseBranch() method of ConditionalBranchController for details
 about how the successful branch is chosen.

 <p>Time is supported by the method delay(double). This delays the
 process until time has advanced the argument time from the current
 model time.  If this method is called with a zero argument, then
 the process continues immediately. As far as each process is
 concerned, time can only increase while the process is blocked
 trying to rendezvous or when it is delayed. A process can be aware
 of the current model time, but it should only affect the model time
 through delays. Thus time is centralized in that it is advanced by
 the director controlling the process represented by this actor.

 <p>A process can also choose to delay its execution until the next
 occasion a deadlock occurs by calling _waitForDeadlock(). The
 process resumes at the same model time at which it delayed. This is
 useful if a process wishes to delay itself until some changes to
 the topology have been carried out.

 <p> The model of computation used in this domain extends the
 original CSP, as proposed by Hoare in 1978, model of computation in
 two ways.  First it allows non-deterministic communication using
 both sends and receives. The original model only allowed
 non-deterministic receives.  Second, a centralized notion of time
 has been added. The original proposal was untimed. Neither of these
 extensions are new, but it is worth noting the differences between
 the model used here and the original model. If an actor wishes to
 use either non-deterministic rendezvous or time, it must derive
 from this class. Otherwise deriving from AtomicActor is sufficient.
