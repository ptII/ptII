//// ConditionalBranchController

/**
 A controller that manages the conditional branches for performing
 conditional communication within CSP (Communication Sequential Processes)
 domain. Any CSP actors (either atomic or composite) that need the
 functionality of conditional communication must contain and instantiate
 an object of this class. In addition, they also needs to implement the
 interface BranchActor.
 <p>
 The conditional branches are supposed to be created within the parent
 actor that contains this controller.
 <p>The chooseBranch() method takes those branches (an array) as an
 argument, and controls which branch is successful. The successful
 branch is the branch that succeeds with its communication. To
 determine which branch is successful, the guards of <I>all</I>
 branches are checked. If the guard for a branch is true then that
 branch is <I>enabled</I>. If no branches are enabled, i.e. if all
 the guards are false, then -1 is returned to indicate this.  If
 exactly one branch is enabled, the corresponding communication is
 carried out and the identification number of the branch is
 returned.  If more than one branch is enabled, a separate thread is
 created and started for each enabled branch. The method then waits
 for one of the branches to succeed, after which it wakes up and
 terminates the remaining branches. When the last conditional branch
 thread has finished, the method returns allowing the parent actor
 thread to continue.
