//// MultiwayBranchController

/**
 This controller manages branches for performing
 multiway rendezvous within the CSP (Communication Sequential Processes)
 domain. Any CSP actors (either atomic or composite) that
 multiway rendezvous should contain an instance of this class.
 In addition, they also needs to implement the
 BranchActor interface.
 <p>
 The multiway branches are created within the parent
 actor that contains this controller.
 The executeBranches() method takes those branches (an array) as an
 argument, and returns when every branch is successful. A successful
 branch is a branch that succeeds with its communication.
 Only branches whose guards are true are <I>enabled</I>.
 If no branch is enabled, i.e. if all
 the guards are false, then executeBranches() returns immediately.
 If exactly one branch is enabled, then
 the corresponding communication is an ordinary rendezvous.
 If more than one branch is enabled, a separate thread is
 created and started for each enabled branch. The executeBranches()
 method then waits for all of the branches to succeed. When the last branch
 thread has finished, the method returns, allowing the parent actor
 thread to continue.
