/**
 This is a base class containing the common code for controllers
 that manage branches for performing conditional or
 multiway rendezvous within the CSP (Communication Sequential Processes)
 domain. Any CSP actors (either atomic or composite) that
 multiway rendezvous should contain an instance of this class.
 In addition, they also needs to implement the
 BranchActor interface.
