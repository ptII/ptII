/**
 CSPDirector governs the execution of a composite actor with the semantics
 of the Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) domain.
 <p>
 In the CSP domain, the director creates a thread for executing each
 actor under its control. Each actor corresponds to a
 process in the model. The threads are created in the initialize
 method and started in the prefire method.  After the thread for an actor
 is started it is <i>active</i> until the thread finishes. While the
 process is active, it can also be <i>blocked</i> or <i>delayed</i>, but
 not both. A process is blocked if it is trying to communicate but
 the process with which it is trying to communicate is not
 ready to do so yet. A process is delayed if it is waiting for
 time to advance, or if it is waiting for a deadlock to occur.
 <p>
 The director is responsible for handling deadlocks, both real
 and timed.  It is also responsible for carrying out any requests for
 changes to the topology that have been made when a deadlock occurs.
 It maintains counts of the number of active
 processes, the number of blocked processes, and the number of
 delayed processes. <i>Deadlock</i> occurs when the number of blocked processes
 plus the number of delayed processes equals the number of active processes.
 <i>Time deadlock</i> occurs if at least one of the active processes
 is delayed. <i>Real deadlock</i> occurs if all of the active processes
 under the control of this director are blocked trying to communicate.
 The fire method controls and responds to deadlocks and carries out
 changes to the topology when it is appropriate.
 <p>
 If real deadlock occurs, the fire method returns. If there are no
 levels above this level in the hierarchy then this marks the end
 of execution of the model. The model execution is terminated by setting
 a flag in every receiver contained in actors controlled by this director.
 When a process tries to send or receive from a receiver with the terminated
 flag set, a TerminateProcessException is thrown which causes the
 actors execution thread to terminate.
 <p>
 Time is controlled by the director. Each process can delay for some
 delta time, and it will continue when the director has advanced time
 by that length of time from the current time. A process is delayed by
 calling delay(double) method. The director <i>advances</i> time each
 occasion a time deadlock occurs and no changes to the topology  are
 pending. If a process specifies zero delay, then the process
 continues immediately. A process may delay itself until the next
 time deadlock occurs by calling waitForDeadlock(). Then the next
 occasion time deadlock occurs, the director wakes up any processes
 waiting for deadlock, and does not advance the current time. Otherwise
 the current model time is increased as well as being advanced.  By default
 the model of computation used in the CSP domain is timed. To use CSP
 without a notion of time, do not use the delay(double) method in any process.
 <p>
 Changes to the topology can occur when deadlock, real or timed, is
 reached. The director carries out any changes that have been queued
 with it. Note that the result of the topology changes may remove the
 deadlock that caused the changes to be carried out.
