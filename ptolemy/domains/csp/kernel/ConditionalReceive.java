//// ConditionalReceive

/**
 Represents a <I>guarded communication statement</I> in which the
 communication is a get(). Thus it represents
 <P>
 <CENTER> guard; get() => statements</CENTER>
 <P>
 It is one branch of either a CDO or a CIF conditional
 communication construct.
 <p>
 The branches used in a conditional communication construct are
 controlled by the chooseBranch() method of ConditionalBranchController.
 <p>
 Each branch is created to perform one communication. If more than
 one branch is enabled (the guard is true or absent), then a thread
 is created for each enabled branch to try and perform
 the appropriate rendezvous. If the branch
 succeeds and is allowed to rendezvous, then it registers itself with
 the controller and the thread it is running in dies. Otherwise it
 continues to try and rendezvous until it succeeds or it is notified that
 another branch has succeeded in with its rendezvous, in which case this
 branch has failed and the thread it is running in dies.
 <p>
 For rendezvous, the receiver is the key synchronization point. The
 receiver with which this branch will try to rendezvous is set upon
 instantiation. It is determined from the port and channel which is
 passed in in the constructor.
 <p>
 The algorithm by which a branch determines whether or not it has
 succeeded with its rendezvous is executed in the run method. There are
 roughly three parts to the algorithm, each of which is relevant
 to the different rendezvous scenarios.
 <br>
 <I>Case 1:</I> There is a put already waiting
 at the rendezvous point. In this case
 the branch attempts to register itself, with the controller, as the first
 branch ready to rendezvous. If it succeeds, it performs the rendezvous,
 notifies the controller that it succeeded and returns. If it is not the first,
 it keeps on trying to register itself until it finally succeeds or another
 branch successfully rendezvoused in which case it fails and terminates. Note
 that a put cannot "go away" so it remains in an inner-loop trying to
 rendezvous or failing.
 <br>
 <I>Case 2:</I> There is a conditional send
 waiting. In this case it tries to register both branches with their
 controllers as the first to try. If it
 succeeds it performs the transfer, notifies the controller and returns. It
 performs the registration in two steps, first registering this branch and
 then registering the other branch. If it successfully registers this branch,
 but cannot register the other, it unregisters itself as the first branch
 trying, and starts trying to rendezvous from the beginning. This is because
 the conditional send could "go away". If it is unable to register itself as
 the first branch to try, it again starts trying to rendezvous from the
 beginning.
 <br>
 <I>Case 3:</I> If there is neither a put or a
 conditional send waiting, it sets a
 flag in the receiver that a conditional receive is trying to rendezvous. It
 then waits until a put is executed on the receiver, or until another branch
 succeeds and this branch fails. If this branch fails, it resets the flag in
 the receiver, notifies the controller and returns. Note that it only needs
 to wait on a put as if a conditional send is executed on the receiver, it is
 the branch which is responsible for checking that the rendezvous can proceed.
 Thus, in the case where two conditional branches are trying to rendezvous
 at a receiver, it is the responsibility of the branch arriving second to
 check that the rendezvous can proceed(see case 2).
