<h1>WirelessDeployment</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>This model internally uses instances of two
actor-oriented classes, CarLightNormal and
PedestrianLightNormal, that are defined in
a separate file. Instances of these classes
are also used in the TrafficLight model, which
is a behavioral model rather than a deployment
model. Since instances of the same classes are
used in both places, changes in one model are
automatically reflected in the other model.
As an exercise, try changing the logic so that
instead of the European system of showing
red and yellow lights together before green,
you use the American system of going directly
to green.</p>
<p>See also the <a href="TrafficLight.htm">functional version</a>
of this model.</p>
