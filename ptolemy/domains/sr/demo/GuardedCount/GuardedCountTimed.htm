GuardedCountTimed is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "GuardedCountTimed.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="GuardedCountTimedVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>This model illustrates the use of SR within DE. The SR director
executes a "tick" of the inside model when it gets either a "start"
event or a "tick" event. Since it is provided with a "tick" event
once per second, it will tick at least that often. Given an input
integer on the "start" input, the SR submodel will count down from
that integer until either it reaches zero or it receives another
input integer. Note that the Default actor inside the SR model
performs a nondeterministic merge, as in Signal, but with the
nondeterminism resolved by the environment model, which is the
DE top-level model.</p>
 <p>See also the 
<a href="GuardedCount.htm">untimed version</a> of this model.</p>
