/**
 A distributor that splits an input stream into a set of output
 streams. The distributor has an input port and an output port, the
 latter of which is a multiport.  The types of the ports are undeclared
 and will be resolved by the type resolution mechanism, with the
 constraint that the output type must be greater than or equal to the
 input type. On each call to the fire method, the actor reads at most
 one token from the input, and writes one token to an output channel.
 If there is no token on the input, then it will not produce a token on
 the current output.  In the next iteration of this actor, it will
 produce an output on the next channel.
