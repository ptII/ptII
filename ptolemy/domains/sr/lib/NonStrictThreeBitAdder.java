/**
 A nonstrict three-bit adder.  This adder has one input port, which is a
 multiport, and two output ports, which are single ports.  All of the ports
 are of type int, and inputs are outputs are single bits.  An exception is
 thrown if a number other than 0 or 1 is received as an input, or if there
 are not exactly three channels connected to the input port.  This actor
 adds the three input bits, and outputs the result to the lowBit and highBit
 ports.  Only two of the inputs must be known for highBit to be determined.
 All inputs are necessary for lowBit to be determined.  An absence of a token
 is considered to have no contribution to the sum (same as value the zero).
 If no input tokens are available at all, then no output is produced.
