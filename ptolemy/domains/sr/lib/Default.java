/**
 A default operator for the SR domain.

 <p>When the <i>preferred</i> input has a token, then the output is equal
 to that token. If the <i>preferred</i> input is absent, then the output is
 equal to the <i>alternate</i> input (whether it is absent or not).
 This actor is non-strict, in that can produce an output even if
 <i>alternate</i> input is unknown. Thus, it can be used to break
 causality loops.
 <p>
 This actor is inspired by the "default" operator in the synchronous
 language SIGNAL, and is similar to the "followed by" operator in Lustre.
 But in the context of the Ptolemy II SR domain, its
 behavior is deterministic. This is because the Ptolemy II SR domain
 has a Lustre or Esterel style master clock, and this actor is given
 the opportunity to fire on each tick of that master clock. In SIGNAL,
 by contrast, this actor can be used to "upsample" to a higher rate
 clock; however, without considerable care, its use in SIGNAL results
 in nondeterminism.
