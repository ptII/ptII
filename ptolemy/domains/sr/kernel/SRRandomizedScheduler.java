/**
 A scheduler the Synchronous Reactive (SR) domain.  This schedule is simply
 a random ordering of all the actors.  The director should cycle through this
 schedule repeatedly, deciding which actors to fire, until it determines
 that the given iteration has converged.  The ordering of the schedule has
 no effect on the results of an iteration.
