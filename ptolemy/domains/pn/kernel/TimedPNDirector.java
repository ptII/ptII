/**
 A TimedPNDirector governs the execution of a CompositeActor with
 Kahn-MacQueen process networks (PN) semantics extended by introduction of a
 notion of global time.
 <p>
 The thread that calls the various execution methods (initialize, prefire, fire
 and postfire) on the director is referred to as the <i>directing thread</i>.
 This directing thread might be the main thread responsible for the execution
 of the entire simulation or might be the thread created by the executive
 director of the containing composite actor.
 <p>
 In the PN domain, the director creates a thread (an instance of
 ProcessThread), representing a Kahn process, for each actor in the model.
 The threads are created in initialize() and started in the prefire() method
 of the ProcessDirector. A process is considered <i>active</i> from its
 creation until its termination. An active process can block when trying to
 read from a channel (read-blocked), when trying to write to a channel
 (write-blocked), or when waiting for time to progress (time-blocked). Time
 can progress for an active process in this model of computation only when the
 process is  blocked.
 <p>
 A <i>deadlock</i> is when all the active processes are blocked.
 The director is responsible for handling deadlocks during execution.
 This director handles three different sorts of deadlocks, real deadlock, timed
 deadlock and artificial deadlock.
 <p>
 A real deadlock is when all the processes are blocked on a read meaning that
 no process can proceed until it receives new data. The execution can be
 terminated, if desired, in such a situation. If the container of this director
 does not have any input ports (as is in the case of a top-level composite
 actor), then the executive director or manager terminates the execution.
 If the container has input ports, then it is up to the
 executive director of the container to decide on the termination of the
 execution. To terminate the execution after detection of a real deadlock, the
 manager or the executive director calls wrapup() on the director.
 <p>
 An artificial deadlock is when all processes are blocked and at least one
 process is blocked on a write. In this case the director increases the
 capacity of the receiver with the smallest capacity amongst all the
 receivers on which a process is blocked on a write.
 This breaks the deadlock and the execution can proceed.
 <p>
 A timed deadlock is when all the processes under the control of this
 director are blocked, at least one process is blocked on a delay (time-blocked)
 and no process is blocked on a write. This director supports a notion of global
 time. All active processes that are not blocked and are executing concurrently
 are executing at the same global time. A process that wants time to advance,
 suspends itself by calling the fireAt() method of the director and specifies
 the time it wants to be awakened at. Time can advance only when a timed
 deadlock occurs. In such a case, the director advances time to the time when
 the first timed-blocked process can be awakened.
