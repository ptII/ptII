/**
 This object implements a thread that obtains read permission to
 a workspace three times sequentially, then calls workspace.wait(obj) on an
 object and exits. The object "obj" on which the wait method is called is an
 inner class of TestWorkspace2 and has a thread of its own. This thread gets a
 write access on the workspace, after the TestWorkspace2 object calls wait(obj)
 on it. Then it gives up the write access and returns.
 To use it, create an instance and then call its start() method.
 To obtain a profile of what it did, call its profile() method.
 That will return only after the thread completes.
 NOTE: This is a very primitive test.  It does not check very much.
