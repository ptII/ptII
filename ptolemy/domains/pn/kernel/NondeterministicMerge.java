/**
 This actor takes any number of input streams and merges them
 nondeterministically.  This actor is intended for use in the
 PN domain. It is a composite actor that
 creates its own contents.  It contains an instance of PNDirector and one
 actor for each input channel (it creates these actors automatically
 when a connection is created to the input multiport).  The contained
 actors are special actors (implemented as an instance of an inner class)
 that read from the port of this actor and write to the port of
 this actor. They have no ports of their own.  The lifecycle of the
 contained actors (when they are started or stopped) is handled by
 the PNDirector in the usual way.

             *          which will trigger IORelation.attributeChanged (expressions
             *          are always lazy, which gives unexpected behavior with the
             *          attributeChanged mechanism).
             *          (Before the cached version of the width was being used at
             *          this moment, which resulted in the wrong value being used
             *          (this was a very old bug).)
             *          The call of IORelation.attributeChanged will set the
             *          cached width, which results in IOPort.attributeChanged
             *          being called, which calls NondeterministicMerge.connectionsChanged
             *          (again!). This one sees that the component has not added yet
             *          and does so. Finally the functions all return and we end up
             *          in the first NondeterministicMerge.connectionsChanged
             *          again. At the time it called getWidth it knew it had to add
             *          the component and does so, but in between this was already
             *          done by the second NondeterministicMerge.connectionsChanged,
             *          which results in the exception.
             *          When I move the code that triggers the width and
             *          adds to new actors to the initialize method of the

             *          initialization process.
             *          Moving the code to preinitialize has the disadvantage however
             *          that width inference might happen multiple times (and definitely
