//// PNProcessListener

/**
 An PNProcessListener is able to receive PNProcessEvents that are issued
 during the execution of a process by a ProcessThread or director in PN.
 In general, an object that implements this interface will probably be a front
 end such as a execution visualization tool for
 the Ptolemy II system, or an object that is communicating with a front end.
 The events are issued only when the event actually occurs, not when it is
 requested.   For example: A process receives a call to pause(), but the
 process may pause some time after the pause was requested. The processPaused()
 method will not be called until the process actually pauses and corresponding
 thread is suspended.
