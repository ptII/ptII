/** 
 * A director for multidimensional dataflow.
 * This is based on Array-OL, as described by:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Boulet, P. (2007). "Array-OL Revisited, Multidimensional Intensive
 * Signal Processing Specification," Technical Report 6113,
 * INRIA, Orsay, France.
 * </ol>
 * The notation used here is intended to follow the spirit of
 * Spear [FIXME: Reference?], from Thales, a software system
 * based on Array-OL. In this notation, unlike Boulet's,
 * domains are named, and patterns for reading and writing
 * arrays are given using those names.
 * <p>
 * [FIXME: the description that follows needs update, the contents and syntax of parameter specs have changed]
 * The execution is governed by the following parameters
 * in the model. In all cases except for the "repetitions"
 * parameter, the parameters are OrderedRecords
 * of the form "[x = n, y = m, ...]", where x and y are arbitrary
 * dimension names and n and m are non-negative integers.
 * For those parameters that support strides, n and m
 * can be replaced by {n,s} or {m,s}, where s is the stride
 * (a positive integer).
 * The stride defaults to 1 in such cases. Unless otherwise
 * stated, the parameters do not support strides.
 * Ports contain the following parameters:
 * <ol>
 * 
 * <li> <i>size</i>: This is a parameter of each output port
 * that specifies the size of the array written by that output
 * port. All dimensions must be specified, and every output
 * port must have such a parameter. [FIXME: true?] In addition, every input
 * port of a composite actor that contains a PthalesDirector
 * must also have such a parameter. 
 * 
 * <li> <i>base</i>: This mandatory parameter gives the base location
 * at which writing begins for each iteration of this director.
 * All dimensions must be specified. The order in which they are
 * specified does not matter.
 * 
 * <li> <i>pattern</i>: This is a parameter of each port that
 * specifies the shape of the array produced or consumed on that
 * port. Moreover, if an actor reads from or writes to the port
 * sequentially (using get() and send() methods), then the pattern
 * specifies the order in which the array is filled.
 * For example, if you send tokens with values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
 * using a pattern [x=3, y=2], then the array is filled as
 * follows:
 * <table>
 * <tr> <td> x </td> <td> y </td> <td> value </td></tr>
 * <tr> <td> 0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 </td></tr>
 * <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 2 </td></tr>
 * <tr> <td> 2 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 3 </td></tr>
 * <tr> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 4 </td></tr>
 * <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 5 </td></tr>
 * <tr> <td> 2 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 6 </td></tr>
 * </table>
 * If on the other hand you specify a pattern
 * [y=2, x=3], then an array of the same shape is used,
 * but it is now filled as follows:
 * <table>
 * <tr> <td> x </td> <td> y </td> <td> value </td></tr>
 * <tr> <td> 0 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 </td></tr>
 * <tr> <td> 0 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 2 </td></tr>
 * <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 3 </td></tr>
 * <tr> <td> 1 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 4 </td></tr>
 * <tr> <td> 2 </td> <td> 0 </td> <td> 5 </td></tr>
 * <tr> <td> 2 </td> <td> 1 </td> <td> 6 </td></tr>
 * </table>
 * If a stride is given, then the pattern may have gaps
 * in it. For example, "x = {2,2}" specifies that two values
 * are produced in the x dimension, and that they are separated
 * by one value that is not produced. Values that are not
 * produced default to zero (the value of zero depends on the
 * data type; for example, zero for strings is the empty string,
 * whereas zero for doubles is 0.0).
 *
 * <li> <i>tiling</i>: This parameter gives the increment of the
 * base location in each dimension for each successive iteration
 * of the actor. This is a property of an output or an input
 * port of an actor.
 * 
 * </ol>
 * 
 * In addition, actors must contain the following parameter:
 * <ol>
 * <li> <i>repetitions</i>: This is a required parameter 
 * for every actor in the Pthales domain. It is an array of
 * positive integers of the form "{ k, l, ... }". It specifies a set
 * of nested loops (equal to the length of the array) and the
 * number of iterations of each loop (from the inner to the outer loop).
 * So "{2, 4}" specifies an inner loop with 2 iterations and an outer loop
 * with 4 iterations. There is a one-to-one mapping between the elements
 * of the repetitions array and the fields of the tiling parameters of all
 * ports of the corresponding actor.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * In all cases, when indexes are incremented, they are incremented
 * in a toroidal fashion, wrapping around when they reach the size
 * of the array. Thus, it is always possible (though rarely useful)
 * for an array size to be 1 in every dimension. [FIXME?]
 * <p>
 * NOTE: It should be possible to define a PtalesPort and
 * PtalesCompositeActor that contain the above parameters, as
 * a convenience. These could be put in a library.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: It should be possible to create a single interface
 * for this director so that when double clicked, it
 * brings up an interactive dialog that has the form of a Spear
 * table. It would have one row per port, plus a header row
 * to specify the iterations.
 * <p>
 * FIXME: Need to export production and consumption data for
 * SDF, allowing these Pthales models to be nested within SDF
 * or within Pthales, which will also allow it to be nested
 * within modal models.
