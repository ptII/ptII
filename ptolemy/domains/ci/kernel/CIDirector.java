/**
 Director of the component interaction (CI) domain. The CI domain supports
 two styles of interaction between actors, push and pull. In push interaction,
 the actor that produces data initiates the interaction. The receiving actor
 reacts to the data. The computation proceeds as data-driven. In pull
 interaction, the actor that consumes data decides when the interaction
 takes place, and the computation proceeds as demand-driven.
 <p>
 When a relation connects the push(pull) output port of one actor with the
 push(pull) input port of another, the style of interaction between the two
 actors is push(pull). To configure a port as a push port, add a parameter
 named <i>push</i> to the port, and give the value "true" to the parameter.
 Ports are pull ports by default. Relations connecting both push and pull
 ports are not supported. (TODO: add check in the director.)
 <p>
 Actors in a CI model are classified as either active or inactive. Each
 active actor is controlled by an {@link ActiveActorManager actor manager},
 which runs asynchronously with respect to the director (i.e. not in the
 same thread of control). Active actors include:
 <ul>
 <li> source actors with push output ports </li>
 <li> sink actors with pull input ports </li>
 <li> actors with pull input ports and push output ports </li>
 </ul>
 These actors initiate all the computation in a CI model. The director
 controls the execution of inactive actors by maintaining a task queue.
 A task in the queue is an inactive actor that either receives a token
 from an active actor via the push interaction, or is requested to
 produce a token by an active actor via the pull interaction. In one
 iteration of the CI model, the director removes the first actor from
 the queue. If the actor is pushed, the computation proceeds as
 data-driven from the actor, until the produced data reach actors that
 are either not ready to fire or with pull output ports and no pending
 pull request. If the actor is pulled, then the computation proceeds
 as demand-driven from the actor, until either the actor is fired or
 the pull request reaches actors that have push input ports and are not
 ready to fire.
