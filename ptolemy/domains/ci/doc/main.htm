<h1>Component Interaction</h1>
<P>

The component interaction (CI) domain models systems that blend
data-driven and demand-driven styles of computation. As an example,
the interaction between a web server and a browser is mostly
demand-driven. When the user clicks on a link in the browser, it pulls
the corresponding page from the web server. A stock-quote service can
use a data-driven style of computation. The server generates events
when stock prices change. The data drive the clients to update their
displayed information. Such push/pull interaction between a data producer
and consumer is common in distributed systems, and has been included in
middleware services, most notably in the CORBA event service. These
services motivated the design of this domain to study the interaction
models in distributed systems, such as stock-quote services, traffic or
weather information systems. Other applications include database
systems, file systems, and the Click modular router.

<p>

An actor in a CI model can be active, which means it possesses its own
thread of execution. For example, an interrupt source of an embedded
system can be modeled as an active source actor. Such a source
generates events asynchronously with respect to the software execution
on the embedded processor. CI models can be used to simulate and study
how the embedded software handles the asynchronous events, such as
external interrupts and asynchronous I/O.
