/**
 <p>A While actor for the sequence domain.
 In an iteration, if an input token is available at the <i>If</i> input,
 that token is read.
 The <i>Then</i> output is set to true, if then <i>If</i> input is true.
 The <i>If</i> port may only receive Tokens of type Boolean. The output
 ports are also of type boolean.</p>

 While is a ControlActor, meaning that it keeps a list of
 enabled output ports.
 The sequence and process director will keep scheduling the While actor
 until its input condition becomes false. Care must be taken when
 using this actor, since it can potentially cause an infinite loop in
 a model's execution.
