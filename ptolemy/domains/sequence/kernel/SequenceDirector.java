//// SequenceDirector

/**
 * A director that executes actors in a sequence explicitly specified
 * by the model. Actors are required to either contain an instance
 * of SequenceAttribute or to be upstream of an actor that contains
 * an instance of SequenceAttribute. Each SequenceAttribute contains
 * a unique integer that specifies the position in the sequence for
 * the actor. This director will sort the list of actors that
 * contain a SequenceAttribute according to these integers, and
 * fire them in order. Before each firing, it will also fire any
 * upstream actors actors that do not contain an instance of SequenceAttribute.
 * FIXME: In what order are those actors fired?
 * FIXME: What if the upstream actors do contain a SequenceAttribute?
 * FIXME: If an actor is upstream of two actors with SequenceAttribute,
 * does it fire twice in an iteration? Are it's output valued queued?
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * The SequenceDirector computes the sequenced actors and passes these in two lists to the 
 * SequenceScheduler (one list for independent sequenced actors, and one list
 * for sequenced actors that are dependent on other actors e.g. control actors)
 * 
 * Please see SequencedModelDirector for more details on how the schedule
 * is computed.
