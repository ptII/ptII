//// SequenceSchedule

/**
 An extension of the Schedule class to support sequenced actors.
 This includes support for control actors and support for upstream actors. 
 If control actors are present, the firing of a SequenceSchedule depends on
 which control branches are chosen.
 
 The SequenceSchedule is different from other schedules in that it 

 This class overwrites actorIterator() and firingIterator().
 FIXME:  actorIterator() is not implemented yet.

 The firingIterator() will evaluate the condition of control actors and determine
 which actors to place in the scheduler next.
 
 FIXME:  add(), insert(), remove() currently not supported.  What should they do for this
 kind of schedule?  Not sure how other entities should be allowed to add to schedule. 
 
 FIXME:  size() is also not correct.  This should probably count all actors in the 
 sub-graphs as well?  How should the control branches be reflected in the size()?  
 Should it just be the number of actors scheduled so far?
 
 FIXME:  toString() not implemented.  
 
 The SequenceSchedule schedules itself...
 
 // Begin Ptolemy standard comments
 
 This class represents a static schedule of actor executions.  An
 instance of this class is returned by the scheduler of a model to
 represent order of actor firings in the model.  A schedule consists of
 a list of schedule elements and the number of times the schedule
 should repeat (called the <i>iteration count</i>). <p>

 Each element of
 the schedule is represented by an instance of the ScheduleElement
 class.  Each element may correspond to a number of firings of a single
 actor (represented by the Firing class) or an entire sub-schedule
 (represented by a hierarchically contained instance of this class).
 This nesting allows this concise representation of looped schedules.
 The nesting can be arbitrarily deep, but must be a tree where the
 leaf nodes represent actor firings.  It is up to the scheduler to
 enforce this requirement. <p>

 The add() and remove() methods are used to add or
 remove schedule elements. Only elements of type ScheduleElement (Schedule
 or Firing) may be added to the schedule list. Otherwise an exception will
 occur. <p>

 The iteration count is set by the
 setIterationCount() method. If this method is not invoked, a default value
 of one will be used. <p>

 As an example, suppose that we have an SDF graph containing actors
 A, B, C, and D, with the firing order ABCBCBCDD.

 This firing order can be represented by a simple looped schedule.  The
 code to create this schedule appears below.

 <p>
 <pre>
 Schedule S = new Schedule();
 Firing S1 = new Firing();
 Schedule S2 = new Schedule();
 Firing S3 = new Firing();
 S.add(S1);
 S.add(S2);
 S.add(S3);
 S1.setActor(A);
 S2.setIterationCount(3);
 Firing S2_1 = new Firing();
 Firing S2_2 = new Firing();
 S2_1.setActor(B);
 S2_2.setActor(C);
 S2.add(S2_1);
 S2.add(S2_2);
 S3.setIterationCount(2);
 S3.setActor(D);
 </pre>
 <p>

 Note that this implementation is not synchronized. It is therefore not safe
 for a thread to make modifications to the schedule structure while
 multiple threads are concurrently accessing the schedule.
