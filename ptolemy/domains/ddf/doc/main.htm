<h1>Dynamic Dataflow</h1>
<P>
The Dynamic Dataflow (DDF) domain is a superset of the Synchronous Dataflow 
(SDF) and Boolean dataflow (BDF) domains. In the SDF domain, an actor consumes 
and produces a fixed number of tokens per firing. This static information makes 
possible compile-time scheduling. In the DDF domain, an actor could change 
the production and consumption rates after each firing. The scheduler makes 
no attempt to construct a compile-time schedule, neither does it attempt to 
statically answer questions about deadlock and boundedness, which are
fundamentally undecidable. Instead, each actor has a set of sequential firing 
rules (patterns) and can be fired if one of them is satisfied, i.e., one particular 
firing pattern forms a prefix of sequences of unconsumed tokens at input ports. 
The scheduler dynamically schedules the firing of actors according to some criteria.  
The canonical actors in the DDF domain include Select and Switch, which consume 
or produce tokens on different channels based on the token received from the 
control port.
