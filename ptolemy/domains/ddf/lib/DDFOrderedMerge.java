/**
 This actor merges two monotonically nondecreasing streams of tokens
 into one monotonically nondecreasing stream. On each firing, it reads
 data from one of the inputs. On the first firing, it simply records
 that token. On the second firing, it reads data from the other input
 and outputs the smaller of the recorded token and the one it just read.
 If they are equal, then it outputs the recorded token. It then records
 the larger token. On each subsequent firing, it reads a token from the
 input port that did not provide the recorded token, and produces at the
 output the smaller of the recorded token and the one just read.
 <p>
 If both input sequences are nondecreasing, then the output sequence
 will be nondecreasing.
 Note that if the inputs are not nondecreasing, then the output is
 rather complex. The key is that in each firing, it produces the smaller
 of the recorded token and the token it is currently reading.
 This derived class only updates rate parameters to indicate the next input
 port.
