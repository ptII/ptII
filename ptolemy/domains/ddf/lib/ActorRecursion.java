/**
 This actor performs actor recursion dynamically during execution.
 Upon firing, it clones the composite actor which contains itself and
 is referred to by the StringParameter <i>recursionActor</i>. It then
 places the clone inside itself and connects the corresponding ports of
 both actors. It uses a local DDFDirector to preinitialize the clone and
 then transfers all tokens contained by input ports of this actor to the
 connected opaque ports inside. It again uses the local DDFDirector to
 initialize all actors contained by this actor and classifies each of them
 such as their enabling and deferrable status. It then transfers all
 tokens contained by output ports of this actor to the connected opaque
 ports outside. It finally merges the local DDFDirector with its executive
 DDFDirector and then removes the local DDFDirector. Thus during execution
 this actor is fired at most once, after which the executive director
 directly controls all actors inside. Since there is no type constraint
 between input ports and output ports of this actor, users have to
 manually configure types for all outputs of this actor.
