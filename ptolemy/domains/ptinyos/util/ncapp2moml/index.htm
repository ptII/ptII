    <h1>ncapp2moml</h1> 

    <p> <a href="http://www.tinyos.net#in_browser" target="_top">TinyOS</a> is an
    event-driven operating system designed for sensor network nodes
    that have very limited resources (e.g., 8K bytes of program
    memory, 512 bytes of RAM).  TinyOS, is used, for example, on the
    Berkeley MICA motes, which are small wireless sensor nodes.  <a
    href="httP://nescc.sourceforge.net#in_browser" target="_top">nesC</a> is an
    extension to the C programming language designed to embody the
    structuring concepts and execution model of TinyOS.

    <p>ncapp2moml is used to convert nesC application files (.nc
    configuration files with no interfaces) into <a
    href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/00/moml#in_browser"
    target="_top">MoML</a> (.moml) files.  This will create Ptolemy II
    models that you can run in Viptos.  You must setup the necessary
    MoML library of nesC components with the <a
    href="../nc2moml/index.htm">nc2moml</a> tool before you can
    successfully open files made with this ncapp2moml tool.

    <h2>Installation instructions</h2>

    <p><BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Note: You must follow the instructions <a
	href="../nc2moml/index.htm">here</a> for running the nc2moml
	tool before you can use models generated with this ncapp2moml
	tool.</B>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <ol>
      <li> Run the script to generate the .moml files from the .nc files.
        <pre>
cd $PTII/ptolemy/domains/ptinyos/util/ncapp2moml
./ncapp2moml
        </pre>
	The <CODE>ncapp2moml</CODE> command will take a few minutes to complete.

        <p> Note: The ncapp2moml tool requires that you build the tools in <CODE>$PTII/bin</CODE>.  Do the following and rerun the script above if they are missing:
        <pre>
cd $PTII/bin
make
        </pre>
      <li> See if it worked:
        <ol> 
          <li> You should see some valid MoML code in:
            <pre>$PTII/vendors/ptinyos/momlapp</pre>
            <br>
            The directory structure should reflect that of the TinyOS
            directory structure.

          <li> 
            <ol>
              <li>Try running Viptos:
                <pre>$PTII/bin/vergil -viptos</pre>

              <li>Open a demo by going to File -&gt; Open File, and
              opening file
              <CODE>$PTII/vendors/ptinyos/momlapp/apps/CntToLeds/CntToLeds.moml</CODE>
              or
              <CODE>$PTII/vendors/ptinyos/momlapp/apps/CntToLeds/CntToLeds-InWireless.moml</CODE>
              (only one of these will have been generated, depending
              on what options were used in running ncapp2moml).

              <li>
                  If you opened CntToLeds.moml, you may wish to
                  run the automatic graph layout by selecting Graph -&gt;
                  Automatic Layout form the menu, or by typing Ctrl-T.

                  <p>If you opened CntToLeds-InWireless.moml, you
                  have to first right-click on the MicaBoard and
                  select Look Inside, then right-click on the
                  MicaCompositeActor and select Look Inside.  Then,
                  you can run the automatic graph layout by selecting
                  Graph -&gt; Automatic Layout form the menu, or by
                  typing Ctrl-T.
            </ol>
