To speed up execution, first set up the DBG environment variable to
eliminate unnecessary debug messages.  If you are running Viptos from
the command line, you can also minimize the shell window that has the
debug output to prevent it from displaying.

If you are using tcsh:
  setenv DBG usr1

If you are using bash:
  export DBG=usr1
