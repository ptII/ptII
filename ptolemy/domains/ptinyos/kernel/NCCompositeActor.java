/**
 A composite actor in the PtinyOS domain with no ports.  This actor is
 always a type opaque composite actor.

 <p> This actor represents a nesC component with no interfaces and no
 .nc implementation.  See {@link PtinyOSDirector} for more information
 on nesC.  This actor should be used when it is not necessary to have
 typed ports that interface to regular Ptolemy II models.  If typed
 ports are needed, then an actor that implements {@link
 ptolemy.domains.ptinyos.kernel.PtinyOSCompositeActor} should be used.

 <p> NCCompositeActor is used as a place holder for nesC (.nc) code
 that the user must write separately in an editor like {@link
 ptolemy.domains.ptinyos.gui.NCCompositeActorTableauFactory}.  The
 user should add ports in the GUI as necessary when adding nesC
 interfaces to their nesC component.  These ports should connect to
 other nesC components.

 <p>FIXME: Test creation of NCCompositeActor that is not at the
 toplevel.
