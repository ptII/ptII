<h1>Rendezvous</h1>
<P>
In the Rendezvous domain in Ptolemy II, each actor executes in
its own thread of control, and communication between actors is
by rendezvous.  If an actor is ready to send a message,
it blocks until the receiving actor is ready to receive it. Similarly if
an actor is ready to receive a message, it blocks until the sending actor
is ready to send it.
<p>
This domain supports both conditional and multi-way rendezvous.
In conditional rendezvous, an actor is willing to rendezvous with
any one of several other actors. In multiway rendezvous, an actor requires
rendezvous with multiple other actors at the same time.
When using conditional rendezvous, the choice of which rendezvous
occurs is nondeterministic, in general.
<P>
The model of computation is based on the CSP model
first proposed by Hoare[1] in 1978. Rendezvous-based communication
is also known as synchronous message passing, but we avoid this
term to avoid confusion with the SR (synchronous/reactive) domain.
