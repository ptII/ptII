//// RendezvousDirector

/**
 This director executes actors in their own threads
 and provides a receiver that implements rendezvous communication.
 The threads are created in the initialize()
 method and started in the prefire() method.  After the thread for an actor
 is started it is <i>active</i> until the thread finishes. While the
 thread is active, it can also be <i>blocked</i>.
 A thread is blocked if it is trying to communicate but
 the thread with which it is trying to communicate is not
 ready to do so yet. A deadlock occurs when all threads are
 blocked. If this director is used at the top level,
 the model stops executing when a deadlock occurs.
 This director is based on the CSPDirector by
 Neil Smyth, Mudit Goel, and John S. Davis II.
