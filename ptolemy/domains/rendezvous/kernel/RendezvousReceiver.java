/**
 * Receiver for rendezvous style communication. In the rendezvous
 * domain, all communication is via synchronous message passing, so
 * both the the sending and receiving processes need to rendezvous at
 * the receiver. For rendezvous, the receiver is the key
 * synchronization point. It is assumed each receiver has at most one
 * thread trying to send to it and at most one thread trying to
 * receive from it at any one time. The receiver performs the
 * synchronization necessary for simple rendezvous (get() and put()
 * operations). This receiver is based on the CSPReceiver class by
 * John S. Davis II, Thomas Feng, Edward A. Lee, Neil Smyth, and Yang
 * Zhao.
