/**
 This actor merges any number of input sequences onto one output
 sequence. It begins by being willing to rendezvous with any input.
 When it receives an input, it then becomes willing to rendezvous
 with the output. After successfully delivering the input token
 to the output, it returns again to being willing to rendezvous
 with any input.
 This actor is designed for use in the rendezvous domain, where it will
 execute in its own thread.
 <p>
 The behavior of this actor is similar to that of the ResourcePool
 actor, except that the ResourcePool actor does buffering.
 That is, the ResourcePool is always ready to rendezvous with
 any input, while this actor is ready to rendezvous with an
 input only after it has delivered the previous input token to
 the output.
