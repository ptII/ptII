/**
 This is a typed composite actor to be a Ptera modal model. A Ptera modal model
 has a Ptera (Ptolemy Event Relation Actor) model inside. The Ptera model has a
 number of events, and scheduling relations may exist between events, meaning
 that the processing of the starting event causes the ending event to occur
 after a certain amount of model time. A scheduling relation may also be guarded
 by a Boolean expression.
 <p>
 The controller of a Ptera modal model is a Ptera controller (instance of {@link
 PteraController}). The Ptera controller contains an {@link PteraDirector},
 which has an event queue to store scheduled events in time-stamp order. The
 Ptera modal model itself also has a Ptera director. The Ptera director in the
 controller maintains its own event queue, and schedules itself to be fired by
 putting the controller in the event queue of the Ptera modal model's director.
 <p>
 An event can have one or more refinements. A refinement can be an actor model,
 an FSM model, or a Ptera model. If a refinement is a Ptera model, then its
 controller reports its earliest event to the controller of this modal model,
 which fires it when the model time reaches the reported time in the future. If
 the Ptera refinement itself contains an event that has a refinement in Ptera,
 that controller reports to the controller one level above, which in turn
 reports to the modal model.
