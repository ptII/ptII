SimultaneousCarWash is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "SimultaneousCarWash.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="SimultaneousCarWashVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>Look inside PteraModalModel to perceive its internal design, which contains a Simulate event
with an Ptera refinement. The Simulate event is processed twice at model time 0, causing two
instances of the refinement's initial event to be scheduled in the refinement's own event
queue. The streams of events occurring in the two simulations are merged in that event
queue and are processed in their time stamp orders.</p>
