/**
 This parameter sets whether execution of a Ptera model is synchronized to real
 time. If it is added to a Ptera controller and it has value true, then the
 Ptera controller delays its event processing to try to keep real time
 synchronized with the advance of model time by incurring real-time delays in
 the execution.
