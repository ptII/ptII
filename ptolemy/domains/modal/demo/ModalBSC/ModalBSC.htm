This modal model by
Zoltan Kemenczy (Research in Motion Limited)
represents a trivial
Binary Symmetric Channel
model with two states, "good" and "bad", each with different
probabilities of error. The same state refinement is used
to generate the error and state change events.
A transition refinement is used to scale the state change
signal from the state refinement to make it more visible
on the scope. If the same refinement is configured for both
state transitions, the scale parameter of the refinement is
set to be different for the two transitions.

<p>Note that the decision which transition to
take is made by the controller based on the state refinement's
state change output (==1) and is not affected by the transition
refinement changing the state change to double (0.5).


<p>The <a href="ModalBSCVergil.htm">block diagram</a>
for the model was constructed using the Ptolemy II schematic editor
called Vergil.
