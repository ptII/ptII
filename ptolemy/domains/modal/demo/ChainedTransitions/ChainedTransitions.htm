ChainedTransitions is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "ChainedTransitions.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="ChainedTransitionsVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>This model shows how Ptolemy II handles the "chained" transitions.</p>
<p>By chained transitions, it means that when a state is entered through
an incoming transition, at least one of its outgoing transitions is 
enabled, and the enabled transition is taken immediately without 
advancing the time. The state is called a "transient" state.</p>

<p>Note, the actions associated with both the incoming and outgoing 
transitions are executed.</p>
