<p>The blending controller has two major control modes, implemented by
controllers A and B inside. When the control mode changes from A to B,
the transition is smoothed by a blending component. This is achieved
by letting the "A to B" state of the mode controller (inside the blending
controller) be refined by three components: Controller_A, Controller_B,
and Blending_A_to_B. The mode change from B to A is managed
symmetrically.</p>
