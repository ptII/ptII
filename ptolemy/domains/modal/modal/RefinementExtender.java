/**
 An attribute to add a class to the list of refinement classes for a state. The
 name of this attribute should be an easy-to-remember name of the refinement
 class to be shown to the user in the dialog displayed when the user chooses to
 add a refinement. The <code>className</code> property of this attribute refers
 to the actual class, which is either a Java class with which the refinement is
 to be created, or a Ptolemy class specified in MoML at the path pointed to by
 the class name.
