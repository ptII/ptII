//// Action

/**
 An Action is contained by a Transition in an FSMActor or an Event in an
 ERGController.
 <p>
 When the FSMActor is fired, an enabled transition among the outgoing
 transitions of the current state is chosen. The choice actions
 contained by the chosen transition are executed. An action is a choice
 action if it implements the ChoiceAction marker interface. A choice
 action may be executed more than once during an iteration in domains
 with fixed-point semantics.
 <p>
 When the FSMActor is postfired, the chosen transition of the latest firing
 of the actor is committed. The commit actions contained by the transition
 are executed and the current state of the actor is set to the destination
 state of the transition. An action is a commit action if it implements the
 CommitAction marker interface.
