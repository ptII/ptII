/**
 An implementation of containment extender for modal models as an attribute.
 This attribute defines a special containment relationship that is slightly
 different from the containment relationship defined by {@link
 NamedObj#getContainer()}. The {@link #getExtendedContainer()} method returns
 the container of the object that contains the implementing attribute. The
 returned container is supposed to be the object that visually contains the
 object that owns the implementing attribute, as seen by the model designer. In
 particular, for a modal model (either FSM or Ptera), even though a refinement is
 visually contained by a state or an event, {@link NamedObj#getContainer()} of
 that refinement does not return the state or event because of a difference
 between the visual representation and internal data representation. In that
 case, {@link #getExtendedContainer()} of this class returns the state or event.
