<h1>Model Model Domain</h1>
<p>Ptolemy II 8.0 includes a substantial rework of modal models and
the underlying finite state machine infrastructure to make them work
predictably and consistently across domains.</p>

<p>Ptolemy II 8.0 includes a new implementation of continuous-time models
based on the semantics given in "<a href="#LeeZheng:07:Leveraging">Synchronous Language Principles for Heterogeneous Modeling
and Design of Embedded Systems</a>." In particular, the Continuous domain cleanly supports
continuous-time models (using an ODE solver), discrete-event models,
and arbitrary mixtures of the two, including signals that combine
continuous-time segments with discrete events. It also interoperates
cleanly with most other domains (pretty much all except PN and
Rendezvous, for which there does not appear to be reasonable semantic
model of such an interaction). Modal models are also cleanly supported
with the Continuous domain, enabling hybrid system modeling with a
rigorous semantics. The Continuous domain is expected to eventually
replace CT.</p>
