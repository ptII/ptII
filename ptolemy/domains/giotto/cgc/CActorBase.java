/**
 This is a base class for actors that are intended to be used with an
 instance of GiottoCEmachineFrameworkGenerator, an attribute that is
 placed in the model and that generates code when the user double clicks on
 its icon. This class provides a parameter <i>source</i> that is
 used to identify the C source file that provides the functionality
 of the actor. The
 .c file along with the generated code  can then be compiled with emachine
 files for a specific platform to generate an executable that runs on
 that platform. This actor also has a second parameter
 <i>frequency</i> that is Giotto specific, and is used to specify the number of
 times the C task associated with this class is executed in a Giotto
 iteration (a "super iteration" in Giotto). It works in conjunction
 with the CActor MoML class, which
 attaches a tableau factory so that look inside will open the C source
 file.
