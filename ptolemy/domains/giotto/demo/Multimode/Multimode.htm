<H1>Multimode Giotto Model</H1>
<p>
This (toy)
example illustrates the use of a finite-state machine (implemented
in the FSM domain) to get a modal Giotto model. </p>

Multimode is available as:
<ul>

    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "Multimode.jnlp";

<p>This model contains three components, all of which have frequency one.</p>

<p>The middle component is a state machine that has three states and starts in state <I>Init</I>.
The transition from <I>Init</I> to <I>State0</I> is always enabled and
will be taken in the first firing of the state machine. The actions on
the transition properly initialize the refinement of <I>State0</I>.
The guards on the transitions between <I>State0</I> and <I>State1</I>
cause the transitions to be taken each time the input to the state
machine is a multiple of 4. The guards read:
<pre>
    in_isPresent && (in % 4 == 0)
</pre>
which is interpreted as follows. The variable <code>in_isPresent</code>
has value <i>true</i> when the input <i>in</i> is present.
The variable <code>in</code> is the value of the input.
The expression will be true when the input is a multiple of 4.</p>

<p>Each state refines to a separate instance of the following model:</p>

<p>In <I>State1</I>, the lower ramp has frequency 2, and therefore increments
at twice the rate of the version in <I>State0</I>.
This is the behavior exhibited by the plot above.</p>
