/**
 A receiver for the Giotto domain. It uses double-buffering. An actor
 may write to a receiver using put at any time. However, a new token
 will only be available to get if update has been called before. The
 update method makes the token from the last put invocation available
 to get. The GiottoDirector delays calls to update according to the
 Giotto semantics.
