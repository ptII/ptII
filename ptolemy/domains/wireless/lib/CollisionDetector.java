//// CollisionDetector

/**
 This actor models a typical physical layer front end of a wireless
 receiver. It models a receiver where messages have a non-zero duration
 and messages can collide with one another, causing a failure to receive.
 A message is provided to this actor at the time corresponding to the
 start of its transmission. Along with the message (an arbitrary
 token), the inputs must provide the duration of the message and its
 power.  The message spans an interval of time starting when it is
 provided to this actor and ending at that time plus the duration.
 If another message overlaps with a given message and has sufficient
 power, then the given message will be sent to the <i>collided</i>
 output.  Otherwise it is sent to the <i>received</i> output. In both
 cases, the message appears at the corresponding output at the time
 it is received plus the duration (i.e. the time at which the message
 has been completed).
 <p>
 The inputs are:
 <ul>
 <li> <i>message</i>: The message carried by each transmission.
 <li> <i>power</i>: The power of the received signal at the
 location of this receiver.
 <li> <i>duration</i>: The time duration of the transmission.
 </ul>
 The power and duration are typically delivered by the channel
 in the "properties" field of the transmission. The power
 is usually given as a power density (per unit area) so that
 a receiver can multiply it by its antenna area to determine
 the received power. It is in a linear scale (vs. DB), typically with
 units such as watts per square meter.  The duration is a
 non-negative double, and the message is an arbitrary token.
 <p>
 The outputs are:
 <ul>
 <li> <i>received</i>: The message received. This port produces
 an output only if the received power is sufficient
 and there are no collisions.  The output is produced at a
 time equal to the time this actor receives the message plus
 the value received on the <i>duration</i> input.
 <li> <i>collided</i>: The message discarded. This port produces
 an output only if the received message collides with another
 message of sufficient power.  The output is produced at a
 time equal to the time this actor receives the message plus
 the value received on the <i>duration</i> input.  The value
 of the output is the message that cannot be received.
 </ul>
 <p>
 This actor is typically used with a channel that delivers a properties
 record token that contains <i>power</i> and <i>duration</i> fields.
 These fields can be extracted by using a GetProperties actor followed
 by a RecordDisassembler. The PowerLossChannel, for example, can be used.
 However, in order for the type constraints to be satisfied, the
 PowerLossChannel's <i>defaultProperties</i> parameter must be
 augmented with a default value for the <i>duration</i>.
 Each transmitter can override that default with its own message
 duration and transmit power.
 <p>
 Any message whose power (as specified at the <i>power</i> input)
 is less than the value of the <i>powerThreshold</i> parameter
 is ignored. It will not cause collisions and is not produced
 at the <i>collided</i> output.  The <i>powerThreshold</i> parameter
 thus specifies the power level at which the receiver simply fails
 to detect the signal.  It is given in a linear scale (vs. DB) with
 the same units as the <i>power</i> input. The default value is zero,
 i.e. by default it won't ignore any received signal.
 <p>
 Any message whose power exceeds <i>powerThreshold</i> has the
 potential of being successfully received, of failing to be
 received due to a collision, and of causing a collision.
 A message is successfully received if throughout its duration,
 its power exceeds the sum of all other message powers
 by at least <i>SNRThresholdInDB</i> (which as the name
 suggests, is given in decibels, rather than in a linear
 scale, as is customary for power ratios).  Formally, let the
 message power for the <i>i</i>-th message be
 <i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>(<i>t</i>) at time <i>t</i>.
 Before the message is received and after its duration
 expires, this power is zero.  The <i>i</i>-th message
 is successfully received if
 <quote>
 <i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>(<i>t</i>) >= <i>P</i>
 <font face="Symbol">S</font><sub>(<i>j</i> != <i>i</i>)</sub>
 <i>p</i><sub><i>j</i></sub>(<i>t</i>)
 </quote>
 for all <i>t</i> where <i>p</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>(<i>t</i>) > 0,
 where
 <quote>
 <i>P</i> = 10^(<i>SNRThresholdInDB</i>/10)
 </quote>
 which is the signal to interference ratio in a linear scale.
 <p>
 The way this actor works is that each input that has sufficient power
 is recorded in a hash table indexed by the time at which its duration
 expires. In addition, the director is requested to fire this actor at
 that time.  Any time a message arrives, the actor checks for collisions,
 and marks any message subjected to a collision by this arrival.
 When the duration expires, the message is produced on one of the
 two outputs depending on whether it is marked as having encountered
 a collision, and it is removed from the hash table.
 <p>
 NOTE: This actor assumes that the duration of messages is short
 relative to the rate at which the actors move. That is, the received
 power (and whether a receiver is in range) is determined once, at the
 time the message starts, and remains constant throughout the transmission.
 It also requires that all three inputs have tokens when fired.
