//// DelayChannel

/**
 Model of a wireless channel with a specified propagation speed and
 loss probability. The propagation speed introduces delay that depends
 on the distance between the transmitter and receiver at the time
 that the transmitter initiates the communication. This channel model
 assumes that the duration of the message is (effectively) zero, so
 that neither the transmitter nor the receiver move during the
 transmission. It also assumes that the receiver does not move during
 propagation. I.e., it assumes that the propagation of the message is
 much faster than the node movement.
 <p>
 A speed equal to Infinity (the default) results in no
 propagation delay. If the loss probability is greater than zero then on each
 call to the transmit() method, for each receiver in range,
 with the specified probability, the transmission to that
 receiver will not occur.  Whether a transmission occurs to a particular
 receiver is independent of whether it occurs to any other receiver.
