//// PowerLossChannel

/**
 This is a model of a wireless channel with a specified power propagation
 formula. The power propagation is given as an expression that is evaluated
 and then multiplied by the power field of the transmit properties before
 delivery to the receiver. For convenience, a variable named "distance"
 is available and equal to the distance between the transmitter and the
 receiver when the power propagation formula is evaluated.  Thus, the
 expression can depend on this distance. The value of the power field should
 be interpreted as power at the transmitter but power density at the receiver.
 A receiver may multiply the power density with its efficiency and an
 area(typically the antenna area). A receiver can then use the resulting
 power to compare against a detectable threshold, or to determine
 signal-to-interference ratio, for example.
 <p>
 The default value of <i>powerPropagationFactor</i> is
 <pre>
 1.0 / (4 * PI * distance * distance).
 </pre>
 This assumes that the transmit power is uniformly distributed
 on a sphere of radius <i>distance</i>. The result of multiplying
 this by a transmit power is a power density (power per unit area).
 The receiver should multiply this power density by the area of the
 sensor it uses to capture the energy (such as antenna area) and
 also an efficiency factor which represents how effectively it capture
 the energy.
 <p>
 The power field of the transmit properties can be supplied by
 the transmitter as a record with a <i>power</i> field of type double.
 The default value provided by this channel is Infinity, which when
 multiplied by any positive constant will yield Infinity, which
 presumably will be above any threshold. Thus, the default behavior
 is to encounter no power loss and no limits to communication due
 to power.
 <p>
 In addition, this channel can have a specified limited transmission
 range. If a transmission range less than Infinity (the default)
 is specified, then receivers outside the specified range will
 not be notified of transmission, irrespective of power loss.
 The transmission range can be specified in one of two ways.
 Either it is the value of the <i>range</i> field in the
 <i>defaultProperties</i> parameter (a record) of this
 channel, or it is provided by the transmitter on each call to
 transmit() as a property argument.  To use the latter mechanism,
 it is necessary that the property token be an instance of RecordToken
 with a field named "range" that can be converted to a double
 (i.e., it can be a double, an int, or a byte).
 The default value for <i>range</i> is Infinity, which
 indicates that by default, there is no range limit.
 <p>
 Any receiver that is within the specified range when transmit()
 is called will receive the transmission, unless the <i>lossProbability</i>
 parameter is set to greater than zero.
