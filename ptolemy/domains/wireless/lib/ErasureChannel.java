/**
 Model of a wireless channel with a specified loss probability. If the
 loss probability is greater than zero then on each
 call to the transmit() method, for each receiver in range,
 with the specified probability, the transmission to that
 receiver will not occur.  Whether a transmission occurs to a particular
 receiver is independent of whether it occurs to any other receiver.
 <p>
 For convenience, a variable named "distance" is available and
 equal to the distance between the transmitter and the receiver
 when the <i>lossProbability</i> is evaluated.  Thus, the
 loss probability can be given as an expression that depends
 on this distance.
 <p>
 The distance between the transmitter and receiver is determined
 by the protected method _distanceBetween(), which is also used
 to set the value of the <i>distance</i> variable that can be
 used in the expression for loss probability.
 In this base class, that method uses
 the _location attribute of the transmit and receive actors,
 which corresponds to the position of the icon in the Vergil
 visual editor.  Subclasses may override this protected method
 to provide some other notion of distance.
