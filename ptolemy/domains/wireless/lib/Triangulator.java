/**
 Given inputs that represent the location of a sensor and the time at
 which those sensors detect an event, this actor outputs the location
 of the source of the event.  It uses the specified
 <i>signalPropagationSpeed</i> and triangulates.
 <p>
 The input is a record with two fields named "location" and "time".
 The location field is an array of doubles, and the time is a double.
 In the current implementation, the actor assumes a two-dimensional space,
 so the location field is assumed to be an array with two doubles,
 which represent the horizontal (east-west) and vertical (north-south)
 location of the sensor.  The time field is assumed to be
 a double representing the time at which the event was detected by
 the sensor.
 <p>
 The triangulation algorithm requires three distinct sensor inputs
 for the same event in order to be able to calculate the location
 of the origin of the event.  Suppose that the event occurred at
 time <i>t</i> and location <i>x</i>.  Suppose that three sensors
 at locations <i>y1</i>, <i>y2</i>, and <i>y3</i> have each detected
 events at times <i>t1</i>, <i>t2</i>, and <i>t3</i>, respectively.
 Then this actor looks for a solution for <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>
 in the following equations:
 <quote>
 distance(<i>x</i>, <i>y1</i>)/<i>v</i> = <i>t1</i> - <i>t</i>,
 <br>
 distance(<i>x</i>, <i>y2</i>)/<i>v</i> = <i>t2</i> - <i>t</i>,
 <br>
 distance(<i>x</i>, <i>y3</i>)/<i>v</i> = <i>t3</i> - <i>t</i>,
 <br>
 </quote>
 where <i>v</i> is the value of <i>propagationSpeed</i>.
 If such a solution is found, then the output <i>x</i> is produced.
 <p>
 Since three distinct observations are required, this actor will
 produce no output until it has received three distinct observations.
 The observations are distinct if the sensor locations are distinct.
 If the three observations yield no solution, then this actor
 will produce no output.  However, it is possible for the three
 observations to come from distinct events, in which case the output
 may be erroneous.  To guard against this, this actor provides a
 <i>timeWindow</i> parameter.  The times of the three observations
 must be within the value of <i>timeWindow</i>, or no output will
 be produced. The output is an array of doubles, which in this
 implementation represent the X and Y locations of the event.
