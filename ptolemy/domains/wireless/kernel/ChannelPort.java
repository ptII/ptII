//// ChannelPort

/**
 This port is used in a channel to mediate type constraints between
 senders and receivers on a wireless channel. The way it works is by
 pretending that it receives data from the sender and sends data to
 the receiver. It does not actually get involved in the transmission
 of data (that is handled by the transmit() method of the channel).
 This port is always both an input and an output.  This port is not
 persistent and is always hidden in a user interface.
 <p>
 NOTE: Someday, perhaps
 this port will be augmented to mediate the communication and
 facilitate the construction of channel models as composite
 actors instead of atomic actors).
