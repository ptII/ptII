/**
 Interface for transmit property transformers.  Property transformers
 are components that register with the channel a callback that they can
 use to modify the transmission properties of a transmission. They can
 register to modify the transmission properties of transmissions from a
 specific port, or they can register to modify all transmissions
 through the channel. Note that if multiple property transformers are
 registered that can operate on a given transmission, then the order
 in which they are applied is arbitrary. Thus, property transformers
 should implement commutative operations on the properties (such as
 multiplying a field by a value).
 <p>
 It is possible to return the modified transmission properties with
 different record types from the previous transmit property, i.e. some
 record fields may be removed or added. The channel should merge the
 returned transmission properties with its <i>defaultProperties</i> to
 make sure that the transmission properties contains at least all the
 fields of the <i>defaultProperties</i>.
 <p>
 Anything that needs to know the locations of the sender and receiver
 to alter the transmit properties should implement this interface.
 For example, for a sender with a specific antenna pattern to send data
 to receivers, it needs to know each receiver's position and its own
 position to calculator the antenna gain. To do so, the sender can
 implement this interface and register itself with the wireless channel
 it uses. The channel will call the <i>transformProperties</I> method
 later and provide the required information for the sender to calculate,
 for example, the antenna gain to a specific receiver.
