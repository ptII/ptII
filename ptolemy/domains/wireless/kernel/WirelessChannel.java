/**
 Interface for wireless channels in the wireless domain.
 Wireless channels are special components in a wireless model.
 They are used to determine the connectivity and deliver
 tokens from the transmitter to receiver(s). This interface
 defines a set of methods for the wireless channel components.
 <p>
 The transmitter can call the channel's transmit() method to
 deliver data to its corresponding receivers. It can specify
 the transmission properties by a record token including the
 transmission range, transmission power. The transmit
 properties may be modified by the channel model or by some
 property transformers(@see PropertyTransformer) during the
 transmission to take into account channel losses, antenna
 gain, noise, etc.
 <p>
 Channel listeners may also be added to this channel.
