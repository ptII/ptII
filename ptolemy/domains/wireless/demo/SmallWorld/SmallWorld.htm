<!-- PT DEPLOYJAVA CONVERTER -->
<p>
SmallWorld is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "SmallWorld.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="SmallWorldVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>This demo shows a sensor network where
each node rebroadcasts the first message
it receives.  An "initiator" component
broadcasts a message, and the model keeps
track of the number of nodes that receive
the message after one hop, after two
hops, etc., and plots a histogram.</p>

<p>If you increase the range above the
"sureRange", then the probability of
delivery drops according to the formula
shown, which keeps the expected number
of recipients roughly constant.  It was
shown by Franceschetti et al. (2003)
that on average, fewer hops are
needed when the range increases.</p>

<p>When you run the demo, the initiator
will broadcast a message. A node turns
red if it receives the message in one hop;
it turns green if it receives the message in
more than one hop.  It stays white if
it never receives the message.</p>
