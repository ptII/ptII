<h1>Collisions</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>In this model, two transmitters broadcast
signals that may collide with one another.
The receiver will correctly receive a signal
if the signal to interference ratio is 3dB
or better, meaning that the received signal
has at least twice the power of the
interfering signal.  When Transmitter1 is
far away from the receiver, it cannot
interfere with the transmission of
Transmitter0.  However, when it gets close,
it can.</p>

<p>The upper plot shows the received power
density (in watts per square meter) seen
by Receiver for both transmitters. It
also shows the duration of the transmissions.
If the transmissions overlap, then one of the
transmissions is surely lost.  The second
is lost only if its power is not greater
than twice the power of the interferer.</p>

<p>The lower plot shows which messages were
received and which were lost.  The messages
from Transmitter1 will always be lost if
they collide with messages from Transmitter0.
However, messages from Transmitter0 can only
be lost when Transmitter1 is close to the
Receiver.</p>
