<h1>ReceiveAntennaPattern</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>This example illustrates modeling receiving antenna gain.
The Receiver has an 8-element beamforming antenna with a
steering angle applied. When you run this model, the
Receiver will move around the Sender and measure the
received power. It then plots the receive power on a
polar plot, with the distance from the origin representing
the received power, and the angle representing the angle
of its position relative to the transmitter.  In effect,
it measures and displays the antenna gain pattern of
the Receiver. (See TransmitAntennaPattern.xml as an example
of modeling transmit antenna gain) </p>
