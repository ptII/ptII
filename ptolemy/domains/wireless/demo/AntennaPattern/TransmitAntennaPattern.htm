<p>This example illustrates modeling transmit antenna gain. The Sender
has an 8-element beamforming antenna with a steering angle applied. 
When you run this model, the Receiver will move around the Sender 
and measure the received power. It then plots the receive power on
a polar plot, with the distance from the origin representing the 
received power, and the angle representing the angle of its position 
relative to the transmitter.  In effect, it measures and displays 
the antenna gain pattern of the Sender. 
(See ReceiveAntennaPattern.xml as an example of modeling receiving 
antenna gain) </p>
