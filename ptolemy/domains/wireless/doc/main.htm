<h1>Wireless Domain</h1>
        Modeling of wireless sensor networks requires sophisticated
        modeling of communication channels, sensor channels, ad-hoc
        networking protocols, localization strategies, media access
        control protocols, energy consumption in sensor nodes,
        etc. This modeling framework is designed to support a
        component-based construction of such models. It is intended to
        enable the research community to share models of disjoint
        aspects of the sensor nets problem and to build models that
        include sophisticated elements from several aspects.
