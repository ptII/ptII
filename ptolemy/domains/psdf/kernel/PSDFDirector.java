/**
 The Parameterized Synchronous Dataflow (PSDF) domain is an
 extension of the Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) domain that allows for
 more extensive reconfiguration of models.  The SDF domain uses
 static analysis of variable dependence to detect cases where rate
 parameters may change.  By default, SDF disallows reconfiguration
 of all rate parameters.  If rate parameters are allowed to change,
 then SDF checks that rate parameters do not change during execution
 of the schedule, and declares that inferred rate parameters for
 external ports change as often as the internal rate parameters.

 <p>This domain offers two key extensions:
 <ol>
 <li> Dependence analysis is used to determine if the modification to the
 rate parameters occurs during execution of the SDF schedule.  If
 this test passes, then a parameterized schedule is constructed.

 <li> The generated schedule is checked for local synchrony, to determine
 if external rate parameters may change.  The correct dependency
 information for external ports is then declared.

 </ol>

 Note that the resulting behavior is identical to the SDF scheduler,
 with rate parameter changes allowed, except much more efficient, since
 scheduling on the fly is not necessary during every reconfiguration.
 Additionally, code can be generated for the PSDF domain that allows
 for efficient reconfiguration.  The added precision of dependency analysis
 for external rate parameters also means that some hierarchical models that
 would be ruled out by the SDF checks are allowed.
