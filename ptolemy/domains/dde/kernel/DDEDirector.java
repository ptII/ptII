/**
 * A DDEDirector governs the execution of actors operating according to the DDE
 * model of computation (MoC). The DDE MoC incorporates a distributed notion of
 * time into a dataflow style communication semantic. Blocking reads occur if
 * attempts to consume data are made when the corresponding receiver is empty
 * and blocking writes occur if attempts to produce data are made when the
 * corresponding receiver is full.
 * <P>
 * In conjunction with the blocking read/write facilities, the DDE domain uses a
 * distributed, local notion of time. In a network of actors governed by a
 * DDEDirector each actor has a local notion of time. Several features of the
 * DDEDirector are intended to facilitate these local notions of time.
 * <P>
 * All DDE models have a completion time. The completion time is a preset time
 * after which all execution ceases. The completion time for a DDEDirector is
 * specified via the <I>stopTime</I> parameter. The value of the stopTime
 * parameter is passed to the receivers of all actors that the DDEDirector
 * governs via newReceiver() during initialize(). After initialize() has been
 * called, the value of stopTime can not be changed.
 * <P>
 * The default value of the stopTime parameter is
 * PrioritizedTimedQueue.ETERNITY. Given this value, a DDE model will continue
 * executing without regard for a completion time.
 * <P>
 * Deadlock due to feedback loops is dealt with via NullTokens. When an actor in
 * a DDE model receives a NullToken, it may advance its local time value even
 * though no computation results directly from consumption of the NullToken. For
 * models with feedback topologies, the FeedBackDelay actor should be used in
 * the feedback loop.
 * <P>
 * The DDE model of computation assumes that valid time stamps have non-negative
 * values. Three special purpose negative time values are reserved with the
 * following meanings. The value of PrioritizedTimedQueue.INACTIVE is reserved
 * to indicate the termination of a receiver. The value of
 * PrioritizedTimedQueue.ETERNITY is reserved to indicate that a receiver has
 * not begun to participate in a model's execution. The value of
 * PrioritizedTimedQueue.IGNORE is reserved to indicate that the current token
 * at the head of a DDEReceiver should be ignored in favor of the tokens
 * contained in the other receivers of the actor in question. More details of
 * IGNORE can be found in FeedBackDelay.
 * <P>
 * NOTE: The current implementation of this director does not include an
 * infrastructure for mutations. Hence, ChangeRequest and other facilities for
 * changing the topology of a model are not included in this director.
