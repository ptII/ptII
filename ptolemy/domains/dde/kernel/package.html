Distributed Discrete Event kernel.
 <p>
The DDE MoC incorporates
   a distributed notion of time into a dataflow style communication
   semantic. Blocking reads occur if attempts to consume data are
   made when the corresponding receiver is empty and blocking writes
   occur if attempts to produce data are made when the corresponding
   receiver is full.
