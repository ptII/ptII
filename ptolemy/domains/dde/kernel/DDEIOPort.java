/**
 A DDEIOPort is a timed input/output port used in the DDE domain.
 DDEIOPorts are used to send tokens between actors, and in so
 doing, associate time with the tokens as they are placed in
 DDEReceivers.
 <P>
 DDEIOPorts are not necessary to facilitate communication between
 actors executing in a DDE model; standard TypedIOPorts are sufficient
 for most communication. DDEIOPorts become useful when the time stamp
 to be associated with an outgoing token is greater than the current
 time of the sending actor.
 <P>
 The designers of models that incorporate DDEIOPorts should be careful
 to make sure that output time stamp ordering information is correct.
 Since the output time stamp of a token being sent through a DDEIOPort
 can be greater then the sending actor's current time, it is possible
 on a subsequent token production to create an outgoing token with
 a time stamp that is greater than the current time but less then the
 previously produced time stamp. In such cases, an
 IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
