//// TimeKeeper

/**
 A TimeKeeper manages an actor's local value of time in the DDE domain.
 A TimeKeeper is instantiated by a DDEThread and is used by the thread
 to manage time for the thread's actor. A TimeKeeper has a list of
 DDEReceivers that are contained by the actor that the thread controls.
 As tokens flow through the DDEReceivers, the TimeKeeper keeps track
 of the advancement of time local to the actor.
 <P>
 DDEReceivers each have three important variables: <I>receiver time</I>,
 <I>last time</I> and <I>priority</I>. The receiver time of a DDEReceiver
 is equal to the time of the oldest event that resides in the receiver.
 The last time is equal to the time of the newest event residing on the
 receiver.
 <P>
 A TimeKeeper manages the DDEReceivers of its actor by keeping track of
 the receiver with the minimum receiver time. The actor is allowed to
 consume a token from a receiver if that receiver has the unique, minimum
 receiver time of all receivers managed by the TimeKeeper. The TimeKeeper
 keeps track of its receivers' priorities as well. The receiver with the
 highest priority is enabled to have its token consumed if the receiver
 shares a common minimum receive time with one or more additional receivers.
 <P>
 The receiver priorities are set using the method _setReceiverPriorities() in
 the following manner. All of the input receivers associated with a given
 TimeKeeper are prioritized according to the inverse order in which they
 were connected in the model topology. I.e., if two input receivers (rA
 and rB) of an actor are connected such that receiver rA is connected
 before receiver rB, then rB will have a higher priority than rA.
 <P>
 The above approach provides each receiver associated with a given
 TimeKeeper with a unique priority, such that the set of receiver
 priorities of the associated TimeKeeper is totally ordered.
 <P>
 A TimeKeeper manages the ordering of receivers by keeping track of
 its receivers and their corresponding receiver times and priorities.
 As tokens are placed in and taken out of the receivers of an actor,
 the TimeKeeper's receiver list is updated. The receiver list is sorted
 by ReceiverComparator. This same information allows the TimeKeeper to
 determine what the current time is local to the actor.
