/**
 A DDEReceiver stores time stamped tokens according to distributed
 discrete event semantics. A <I>time stamped token</I> is a token
 that has a time stamp associated with it. A DDEReceiver stores time
 stamped tokens by enforcing a blocking read and blocking write style.
 Time stamped tokens are appended to the queue with one of the two put()
 methods, both of which block on a write if the queue is full. Time
 stamped tokens are removed from the queue via the get() method. The
 get() method will throw a NoTokenException if it is invoked when the
 hasToken() method returns false.
 <P>
 Each DDEReceiver is managed by a TimeKeeper. A single time keeper is
 assigned to manage all of the receivers of a given actor by keeping
 track of the actor's local notion of time. As tokens are consumed
 (returned by the get() method) in a receiver, the local time of the
 actor will advance to the value of the consumed token's time stamp.
 The hasToken() method of a receiver will return true only if the
 receiver's get() method will result in the minimum advancement of local
 time with respect to all of the receivers controlled by the TimeKeeper.
 If the get() method of multiple receivers will result in a minimum
 but identical local time advancement, then the hasToken() method of the
 receiver with the highest priority will return true (the others will
 return false).
 <P>
 If a receiver with a nonnegative receiver time is empty, then the
 hasToken() method will perform a blocking read. Once, a token is
 available then hasToken() will return true or false according to
 the minimum time advancement rules cited in the preceding paragraph.
 Note that hasToken() blocks while get() does not block.
 <P>
 DDEReceivers process certain events that are hidden from view by
 ports and actors. In particular, NullTokens have time stamps with
 a value of PrioritizedTimedQueue.IGNORE. NullTokens allow actors
 to communicate information on their local time advancement to
 neighboring actors without the need for an actual data exchange.
 NullTokens are passed at the receiver level and circumvent the
 Ptolemy II data typing mechanism.
 <P>
 Time stamps of value PrioritizedTimedQueue.IGNORE are used to initiate
 execution in feedback cycles. If a receiver has a time stamp with
 value IGNORE, then it will not be considered when determining which
 receiver's get() method will result in the minimum local time
 advancement. Once a single token has been consumed by any other
 receiver, then the event with time stamp of value IGNORE will be
 removed. If all receivers have receiver times of IGNORE, then all
 such events will be removed.
 <P>
 IMPORTANT: This class assumes that valid time stamps have non-negative
 values. Reserved negative values exist for special purposes: INACTIVE
 and IGNORE. These values are attributes of PrioritizedTimedQueue.
