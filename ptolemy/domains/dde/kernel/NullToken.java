//// NullToken

/**
 A NullToken is a marker class used to break deadlock in certain
 topologies of DDE models. A NullToken object does not represent
 modeled computation but serves as an indicator that an actor in
 a DDE model can safely advance time to be equal to the time stamp
 associated with the NullToken.
 <P>
 NullTokens are not part of the Ptolemy II type lattice. As such,
 a NullToken will violate type resolution if passed through a
 typed IO port. For this reason, Null Tokens are placed directly
 into receivers without using the send() method of TypedIOPort.
 This tactic circumvents type resolution constraints and affirms
 the notion that NullTokens do not represent computation and hence
 should never be incorporated into actor code. Note further, that
 the get() method of DDEReceiver does not return NullTokens but
 instead consumes them and then proceeds until a "real" token
 becomes available.
