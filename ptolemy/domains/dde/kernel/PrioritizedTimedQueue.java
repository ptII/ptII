//// PrioritizedTimedQueue

/**
 A FIFO queue with time and priority attributes that is used for
 storing tokens with time stamps. A "time stamp" is a time value that
 is associated with a token and is used to order the consumption of a
 token with respect to other time stamped tokens. To help organize the
 tokens contained by this queue, two flags are maintained: <I>last time</I>
 and <I>receiver time</I>. The last time flag is defined to be equivalent
 to the time stamp of the token that was most recently placed in the queue.
 The receiver time flag is defined as the time stamp of the oldest token in
 the queue or the last token to be removed from the queue if the queue is
 empty. Both of these flags must have monotonically, non-decreasing values
 (with the exception of the IGNORE, INACTIVE and ETERNITY values). At the
 conclusion of a simulation run the receiver time is set to INACTIVE.
 <P>
 A PrioritizedTimedQueue is subclassed by DDEReceiver. Hence,
 PrioritizedTimedQueues serve as the foundation for receivers
 contained in the IO ports of actors operating within DDE models.
 A TimeKeeper object is assigned to each actor that operates according to
 the DDE model of computation. The TimeKeeper manages each of the receivers
 that are contained by an actor by keeping track of the receiver times of
 each receiver. As information flows through a PrioritizedTimedQueue, the
 TimeKeeper must be kept up to date with respect to the receiver times.
 The TimeKeeper orders the PrioritizedTimedQueues according to their receiver
 times and priorities. PrioritizedTimedQueues with smaller receiver times are
 ordered first.
 <P>
 PrioritizedTimedQueues with identical receiver times are sorted according
 to their respective priorities. PrioritizedTimedQueues are assigned
 priorities (a nonnegative integer) by a TimeKeeper when the TimeKeeper
 is instantiated. Receivers with higher receiver priorities are ordered
 before receivers with lower priorities. The priority of a receiver can be
 explicitly specified or it can be implicitly determined based on the
 topology. In the latter case, the priority of a receiver is set according
 to the inverse order in which it was connected to the model topology.
 I.e., if two input receivers (receiver A and receiver B) are added to
 an actor such that receiver A is connected in the model topology before
 receiver B, then receiver B will have a higher priority than receiver A.
 <P>
 If the oldest token in the queue has a time stamp of IGNORE, then the
 next oldest token from the other receivers contained by the actor in
 question will be consumed and the token time stamped IGNORE will be
 dropped. The IGNORE time stamp is useful in feedback topologies in which
 an actor should ignore inputs from a feedback cycle when the execution of
 the model is just beginning. FeedBackDelay actors output a single IGNORE
 token during their initialize() methods for just this reason. In general,
 IGNORE tokens should not be handled unless fundamental changes to the
 DDE kernel are intended.
 <P>
 The values of the package friendly variables IGNORE, INACTIVE and ETERNITY
 are arbitrary as long as they have unique, negative values. ETERNITY is
 used in conjunction with the completionTime to indicate that an actor
 should continue executing indefinitely.
 <P>
 Note that a PrioritizedTimedQueue is intended for use within a
 multi-threaded environment. PrioritizedTimedQueue does not
 require the synchronization facilities provided by
 ptolemy.kernel.util.Workspace. PrioritizedTimedQueue is subclassed
 by DDEReceiver which adds significant synchronization facilities
 and where appropriate employs workspace.
