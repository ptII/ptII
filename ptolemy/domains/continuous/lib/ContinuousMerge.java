/**
 A merge actor for the Continuous domain. This port has a multiport
 input and on each firing, sends the input from channel 0 to the
 output, if the input at channel 0 is present. Otherwise, it sends
 the input from channel 1, if it is present. It continues to search
 the inputs in channel order until it finds one that is present
 or it runs out of input channels. In the latter case, the output
 will be absent.
 <p>
 Note that this actor can merge continuous signals with discrete
 ones, but the resulting signal will not be piecewise continuous.
 This will be a bit odd.
