<h1>Continuous Domain</h1>
<P>
The Continuous Domain is a redesign of the Continuous Time (CT) domain with
a rigorous semantics documented in the following papers:

The domain models systems with continuous dynamics, including
for example analog circuits and mechanical systems, but also
cleanly supports discrete events, modal behaviors, and signals that
mix continuous-time behaviors with discrete events.
Models for continuous dynamics are equivalent to linear or nonlinear
integral equations. A sophisticated numerical solver for these equations
is integrated with the director.
The clean semantics of the Continuous domain enables its integration
in hierarchical heterogeneous models that use the Synchronous/Reactive (SR)
and Discrete Event (DE) domains. Arbitrary hierarchical mixtures of these
domains are supported, although if SR is at the top level, then the
<i>period</i> parameter of the director must be used so that time advances.
Domain interactions are documented in the following paper:
