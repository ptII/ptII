/**
 Interface for actors and directors that control integration step sizes.
 This interface should be implemented by components that discover
 breakpoints during an integration step (such as level-crossing
 detectors) and by integrators.
 <P>
 Actors can affect the integration step size in two ways. The first one
 is by introducing predictable breakpoints. To request a breakpoint
 at time <i>t</i>, an actor can call the fireAt()
 method of ContinuousDirector with a time argument <i>t</i>,
 the director will treat <i>t</i> as a breakpoint. Actors that only
 introduce predictable breakpoints need not implement this interface.
 The director guarantees that no step size will be use that is large
 enough to step over <i>t</i>.
 <P>
 The second way of controlling step size is through checking the accuracy
 after each integration step. We treat an integration step as accurate if
 the numerical integration error is less than the error tolerance and
 there are no (unpredicted) breakpoints within this step.
 Actors that use this mechanism need to implement this interface.
 At the end of each integration step, each actor that implements this
 interface will be asked whether this step is accurate by calling its
 isStepSizeAccurate() method. If this method returns false, then all
 actors that implement this interface will be asked to suggest a
 refined step size (by calling refinedStepSize()). The integration step
 will be repeated with the smallest of these suggestions.
 <p>
 If all actors that implement this interface find the integration
 step accurate, then they will be asked for a suggested next step size
 (by calling suggestedStepSize()).
 The smallest of these suggested step sizes will be used for the next
 integration step.
 <P>
 If there are no step size control actors in a model, the step size
 is controlled by the director.  Most (or possibly all) CT directors
 will leave the default step size at its initial value and only deviate
 from these steps when there is a predictable breakpoint that does not
 coincide with one of these steps.
