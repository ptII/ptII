/**
 The continuous time domain is a timed domain that supports
 continuous-time signals, discrete-event signals, and mixtures of the
 two. There is a global notion of time that all the actors are aware of.
 The semantics of this domain is given in the following two papers:
 <ul>
 <li>
 Edward A. Lee and Haiyang Zheng, "<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/05/OperationalSemantics/#in_browser">Operational Semantics of Hybrid Systems</a>,"
 Invited paper in Proceedings of Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control
 (HSCC) LNCS 3414, Zurich, Switzerland, March 9-11, 2005.</li>
 <li>
 Edward A. Lee, Haiyang Zheng, "<a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/publications/papers/07/unifying/index.htm#in_browser">Leveraging Synchronous Language Principles for Heterogeneous Modeling and Design of Embedded Systems</a>,"
 EMSOFT 07, September 30-October 3, 2007, Salzburg, Austria.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 A signal is a set of "events," each of which has a tag and value.
 The set of values includes a special element, called "absent", denoting
 the absence of a (normal) value.
 This director uses superdense time, where every event has a tag
 that is a member of the set RxN.
 R is a connected subset of the real numbers (giving "time",
 and approximated by instances of the Time class),
 and N is the natural numbers (giving an "index").
 At a time <i>t</i>, a signal
 may have multiple values in sequence with tags
 (<i>t</i>, 0), (<i>t</i>, 1)... Its "initial value" is the value
 at tag (<i>t</i>, 0). It typically settles to
 a "final value" after a finite number of indices.
 If it fails to settle to a final value, the signal is said to
 have a "stuttering Zeno" condition, and time will not progress.</p>
 <p>
 In our semantics, all signals are piecewise continuous.
 This means that the initial value, as a function of time,
 is continuous on the left, the final value, as a function
 of time, is continuous on the right, and the signal
 has exactly one value (meaning the initial value and the final value
 are the same) at all times except those
 on a discrete subset D.</p>
 <p>
 A purely continuous signal has exactly one value at
 all times, meaning that the final value equals the initial
 value at all times.
 A purely discrete signal has
 initial value "absent" and final value "absent" at all
 times, and at a discrete subset of the times, it may
 have non-absent values. The only signal that is both
 purely continuous and purely discrete is the one that
 is absent at all tags.</p>
 <p>
 A signal may be mostly continuous,
 but have multiple values at a discrete subset of times.
 These multiple values semantically represent discontinuities
 in a continuous signal that is not purely continuous.</p>
 <p>
 The set of times where signals have more than one distinct value
 is a discrete subset D of the time line. These times are called
 "breakpoints" and are treated specially in the execution.
 Between these times, an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
 solver governs the execution. Initial values are always given
 by the ODE solver.</p>
 <p>
 The parameters of this director are:
 <ul>
 <li> <i>startTime</i>: The start time of the
 execution. This parameter has no effect if
 this director is not at the top-level of a model.</li>

 <li> <i>stopTime</i>: The stop time of the execution.
 When the current time reaches this value, postfire() will return false.
 This will occur whether or not this director is at the top level.</li>

 <li> <i>initStepSize</i>: The suggested integration step size.
 If the ODE solver is a fixed step size solver, then this parameter
 gives the step size taken. Otherwise, at the start of execution,
 this provides the first guess for the integration step size.
 In later iterations, the integrators provide the suggested step
 size. This is a double with default value 0.1</li>

 <li> <i>maxStepSize</i>: The maximum step size.
 This can be used to prevent the solver from too few
 samples of signals. That is, for certain models, it might
 be possible to get accurate results for very large step
 sizes, but plots of the signals may be misleading (even
 if they are accurate) because they represent the signal
 with only a few samples. The default value is 1.0.</li>

 <li> <i>maxIterations</i>:
 The maximum number of iterations that an
 ODE solver can use to resolve the states of integrators.
 Implicit solvers, for example, iterate until they converge,
 and this parameter bounds the number of iterations.
 An example of an implicit solver is the BackwardsEuler solver.
 The default value is 20, and the type is int.
 FIXME: Currently, this package implements no implicit solvers.</li>

 <li> <i>ODESolver</i>:
 The class name of the ODE solver used for integration.
 This is a string that defaults to "ExplicitRK23Solver",
 a solver that tends to deliver smooth renditions of signals.
 The "ExplicitRK45Solver" may be more efficient in that it can
 use larger step sizes, but the resulting signals when displayed
 may be more jagged in appearance.
 Solvers are all required to be in package
 "ptolemy.domains.continuous.kernel.solver".
 If there is another ContinuousDirector above this one
 in the hierarchy, then the value of this parameter is ignored and the
 solver given by the first ContinuousDirector above will be used.</li>

 <li> <i>errorTolerance</i>: This is the local truncation
 error tolerance, used for controlling the integration accuracy
 in variable step size ODE solvers, and also for determining whether
 unpredictable breakpoints have been accurately identified. Any actor
 that implements ContinuousStepSizeControl may use this error
 tolerance to determine whether the current step is accurate.
 For example, if the local truncation error
 in some integrator is greater than this tolerance, then the
 integration step is considered to have failed, and should be restarted with
 a reduced step size. The default value is 1e-4.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 This director maintains a breakpoint table to record all predictable
 breakpoints that are greater than or equal to
 the current time. The breakpoints are sorted in chronological order.
 Breakpoints at the same time are considered to be identical, and the
 breakpoint table does not contain duplicate time points. A breakpoint can
 be inserted into the table by calling the fireAt() method. The fireAt method
 may be requested by the director, which inserts the stop time of the
 execution. The fireAt method may also be requested by actors and the
 requested firing time will be inserted into the breakpoint table.</p>
 <p>
 This director is designed to work with any other director that
 implements the strict actor semantics. As long as the other director does
 not commit state changes except in postfire(), that director
 can be used within the model controlled by
 this director. If, in addition to implementing the strict
 actor semantics that other director also respects calls to
 fireAt(), then this director may be used within a model
 governed by that director.</p>
 <p>
 This director is based on the CTDirector by Jie Liu and Haiyang Zheng,
 but it has a much simpler scheduler and a fixed-point semantics.</p>
