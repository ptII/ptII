/**
 Abstract base class for ODE solvers. A complete integration
 consists of one or more rounds of executions. One round of execution requires
 the model time to be advanced and this advancement is handled by the
 Continuous director. Derived classes need to tell how many rounds
 of execution are necessary and how much time to advance for each round.
 <P>
 How many rounds are needed in one integration is solver dependent. For some
 solving algorithms, (i.e. the so called explicit methods) the number of
 rounds is fixed. For some others (i.e. implicit methods), the number of
 rounds can not be decided beforehand.
 <P>
 A round counter is a counter for the number of rounds in one integration.
 It helps the solvers to decide how to behave under different rounds.
 The round counter can be increased by the calling the _incrementRound()
 method. The _reset() method always resets the counter to 0. These methods are
 protected because they are only used by Continuous directors.
 <p>
 Conceptually, ODE solvers do not maintain simulation parameters,
 like step sizes and error tolerance. They get these parameters from the
 director. So the same set of parameters are shared by all the solvers
 in a simulation.
