This demo shows that different clocks have 
different behaviors in CT domain.

<p>The clocks have the same period as 0.5. 
The above two clocks have offsets as {0.0, 0.2},
while the bottom one has offsets as {0.1, 0.2}.</p>

<p>The two continuous clocks generate discontinuities
at their offsets and the discontinuities are shown
on the simulations results explicitly. While the
discrete clock doesn't show that.</p>
