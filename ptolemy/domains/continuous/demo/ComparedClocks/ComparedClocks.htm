This demo shows that different clocks have 
different behaviors in CT domain.

<!-- PT DEPLOYJAVA CONVERTER -->

ComparedClocks is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "ComparedClocks.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="ComparedClocksVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

The clocks have the same period as 0.5. 
The above two clocks have offsets as {0.0, 0.2},
while the bottom one has offsets as {0.1, 0.2}.

<p>The two continuous clocks generate discontinuities
at their offsets and the discontinuities are shown
on the simulations results explicitly. While the
discrete clock doesn't show that.

<p>The <a href="ComparedClocksVergil.htm">block diagram</a>
for the model was constructed using the Ptolemy II schematic editor
called Vergil.
