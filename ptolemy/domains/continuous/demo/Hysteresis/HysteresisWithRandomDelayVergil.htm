<h1>HysteresisWithRandomDelay</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>This is a stochastic hybrid system modeling hysteresis where
the time it takes to react to a threshold crossing is random.
Specifically, when the sinewave crosses the lowThreshold going
down, then after a random delay, the output goes low.  When
the sinewave crosses the highThreshold going up, then after
another random delay, the output goes high.

Some hybrid systems formalisms define guards so that when a
guard is true, a transition is enabled.  In such a formalism,
the time between when a guard becomes true and the transition
is taken is nondeterministic. This model illustrates how to
get the same effect using the Ptolemy II semantics, where as
soon as a guard becomes true, the transition is always taken.</p>
