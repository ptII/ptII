<h1>HysteresisWithRandomDelay</h1>
This is a stochastic hybrid system modeling hysteresis where
the time it takes to react to a threshold crossing is random.
Specifically, when the sinewave crosses the lowThreshold going
down, then after a random delay, the output goes low.  When
the sinewave crosses the highThreshold going up, then after
another random delay, the output goes high.

Some hybrid systems formalisms define guards so that when a
guard is true, a transition is enabled.  In such a formalism,
the time between when a guard becomes true and the transition
is taken is nondeterministic. This model illustrates how to
get the same effect using the Ptolemy II semantics, where as
soon as a guard becomes true, the transition is always taken.

HysteresisWithRandomDelay is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "HysteresisWithRandomDelay.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="HysteresisWithRandomDelayVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.
