<h1>Satellite</h1>
This demo shows how a satellite moves around the earth and moon 
under the gravities. We assume that the satellite, the earth, and the
moon are in the same plane. We also assume there is no friction and 
the earch and moon are prefectly round. 

y1 and y2 are the positions of the satellite relative to the earch and
moon. The earth resides on (-miu, 0) and the moon resides on (1-miu, 0) 
always. The constant miu is defined as 
        Mass_of_Moon / (Mass_of_Moon + Mass_of_Earth) = 0.012129.

The trajectory of the satellite is a periodic curve and the period is 
around 6.192169. 

This demo is based on the example 10.6 in "Introduction of Computation Method",
by Cuiwei Xu, 1985, Higher Education Press.

Satellite is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "Satellite.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="SatelliteVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.
