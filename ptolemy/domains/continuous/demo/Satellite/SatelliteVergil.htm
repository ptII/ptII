<h1>Satellite</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>This demo shows how a satellite moves around the earth and moon 
under the gravities. We assume that the satellite, the earth, and the
moon are in the same plane. We also assume there is no friction and 
the earch and moon are prefectly round. 

<p>y1 and y2 are the positions of the satellite relative to the earch and
moon. The earth resides on (-miu, 0) and the moon resides on (1-miu, 0) 
always. The constant miu is defined as 
<br>
        Mass_of_Moon / (Mass_of_Moon + Mass_of_Earth) = 0.012129.

<p>The trajectory of the satellite is a periodic curve and the period is 
around 6.192169. 

<p>This demo is based on the example 10.6 in "Introduction of Computation Method",
by Cuiwei Xu, 1985, Higher Education Press.
