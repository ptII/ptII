<h1>SampledClocks</h1>
This model illustrates continuous-time signals
and discrete signals. It shows that samples of
a piecewise continuous signal have the value of
the signal at the start of the discontinuity,
as one would expect in hardware samplers that
require a setup time.  In the semantics of
HyVisual (and continuous-time in Ptolemy II),
piecewise continuous signals have more than
one value at the time of the discontinuity.

Discrete signals can also be sampled, but if
the discrete signal has only one value at each
discrete time, then the samples will reflect
exactly that value. 

In this example, a triggered sampler is used
to sample the discrete signal, and every
second discrete clock output is sampled.

SampledClocks is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "SampledClocks.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="SampledClocksVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.
