<h1>SinuBouncingBall</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>This model models a 3-D ball bouncing on a sinusoidal
surface. Double-click the right yellow block for a 
graphic view. 

The ball collides with the surface and bounces with 
some energy loss, which is specified by the lambda 
parameter. The bouncing direction depends on the 
slope of the surface. There is no extra force except 
the gravity force applied on the ball. 

This model is a Zeno model. We use two states for
pre-Zeno and post-Zeno dynamics respectively.</p>
