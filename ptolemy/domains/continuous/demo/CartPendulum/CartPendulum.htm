<p>
CartPendulum is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "CartPendulum.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="CartPendulumVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>This model models a pendulum on a moving cart. The card moves in the x dimension and the pendulum
moves in x-z plane, as shown in the image above. The pendulum collides with the surface of the cart and
bounces back with some energy loss, specified by the lambda parameter. There is no extra force except
the gravity force applied on the pendulum. In the 3D animation, the x dimension is coming out of the screen.</p>

<p>This model is a Zeno model, where an infinite number of events occur in a finite time.
The model has two modes, one for pre-Zeno and for post-Zeno dynamics. This illustrates the
ability to model Zeno systems in a reasonable way.</p>
