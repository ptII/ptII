This model shows how to handle hybrid systems with both continuous
and discrete inputs (and outputs). The DiscreteClock actor generates
a sequence of discrete events which trigger the transition of the 
FSM inside the continuous time composite actor. The FSM routes one
of the two continuous time input signals to the output.
