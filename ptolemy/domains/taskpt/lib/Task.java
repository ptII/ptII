//// Task

/** A task in the taskpt domain. It consumes all input tokens at the 
 * beginning and produces all output tokens at the end. 
 * 
 * <p>Input and output tokens are not passed directly, but via pointers that point to
 * an address (range) in a shared memory that is controlled by the director
 * of the container of a task. That's why a task has input/output ports for
 * specifying the outputs. The token on the outside of this port specifies 
 * the address, where the tokens have to be stored in the shared memory. The 
 * inside of this port receives the tokens to be stored. A task
 * works on copies of the data read from memory. A 
 * TaskDirector takes care of transferring the outputs and inputs. The TaskDirector
 * also provides a shared memory that is exclusive to all actors within this task.
 * This ensures that a task is free of side effects.</p>
