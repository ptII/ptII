<h1>FixPoint</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>This model compares fixed-point (quantized)
data against unquantized data.</p>
<p>The precision of the first fixed-point conversion is controlled by the
parameters of the DoubleToFix actor.  The default precision is
[4,2], which means that a total of 4 bits are used, 2 of which
are integer bits.
By default, the input is rounded to the nearest representable
number. You can change the strategy by changing the <i>quantization</i>
parameter of the DoubleToFix actor.</p>
<p>The precision of the second second quantization
is controlled by the FixToFix actor, which has a default precision
of [3,2].  Thus, the second quantizer reduces by one the number
of fractional bits.  In addition, it uses an overflow model
called "overflow_to_zero".  You can modify these properties
by right clicking on the actor icons above and selecting
"Edit Parameters".</p>
<p>The fixed-point numbers are represented in two's-complement
notation.  Thus, the set of
numbers that can be represented with a [3, 2] precision is:</p>
<p>
<PRE>
  { -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 }
