<P>
The following model converts a sequence of floating-point numbers to
fixed point, and then further quantizes the fixed point numbers.

<P>
The precision of the first fixed-point conversion is controlled by the
parameters of the DoubleToFix actor.  The default precision is
[4,2], which means that a total of 4 bits are used, 2 of which
are integer bits.
By default, the input is rounded to the nearest representable
number. You can change the strategy by changing the <i>quantization</i>
parameter of the DoubleToFix actor.
<p>
The precision of the second second quantization
is controlled by the FixToFix actor, which has a default precision
of [3,2].  Thus, the second quantizer reduces by one the number
of fractional bits.  In addition, it uses an overflow model
called "overflow_to_zero".  You can modify these properties
by right clicking on the actor icons above and selecting
"Edit Parameters".
<p>
The fixed-point numbers are represented in two's-complement
notation.  Thus, the set of
numbers that can be represented with a [3, 2] precision is:
