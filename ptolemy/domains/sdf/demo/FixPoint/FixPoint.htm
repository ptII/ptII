<H1>Fixpoint Conversion</H1>
<p>The following model converts a sequence of floating-point numbers to
fixed point, and then further quantizes the fixed point numbers.</p>
<!-- PT DEPLOYJAVA CONVERTER -->
<p>
FixPoint is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "FixPoint.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="FixPointVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>The precision of the first fixed-point conversion is controlled by the
parameters of the DoubleToFix actor.  The default precision is
[4,2], which means that a total of 4 bits are used, 2 of which
are integer bits.
By default, the input is rounded to the nearest representable
number. You can change the strategy by changing the <i>quantization</i>
parameter of the DoubleToFix actor.</p>
<p>The precision of the second second quantization
is controlled by the FixToFix actor, which has a default precision
of [3,2].  Thus, the second quantizer reduces by one the number
of fractional bits.  In addition, it uses an overflow model
called "overflow_to_zero".  You can modify these properties
by right clicking on the actor icons above and selecting
"Edit Parameters".</p>
<p>The fixed-point numbers are represented in two's-complement
notation.  Thus, the set of
numbers that can be represented with a [3, 2] precision is:</p>

  { -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 }
