<P>
<p>Using the right mouse button, sketch a signal in the plot window.</p>
<p>The signal is multiplied by a sine wave.
<!-- PT DEPLOYJAVA CONVERTER -->
<p>
Sketch is available as:
<ul>
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "Sketch.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li>An <a href="SketchVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
<script>

deployJava.displayWebStartMessage("../../../../../"); </script>
<!-- /PT DEPLOYJAVA CONVERTER -->
</p>
<p>Notice that you can zoom in with the left mouse button
and very precisely control the sketched curve.
You can also update just portion of the curve by sketching over
only a subset of the horizontal axis.
<!-- FIXME: The following doesn't work.
You can undo your updates by typing Control-Z (the undo history is infinite).
You can redo what you have undone by typing Control-Y.  For undo and
redo to work, you have to make sure the focus is in the plot window
(clicking on the fill button will do this).

<p>This model is implemented by a
<a href="SketchApplet.java">custom applet</a>,
which uses as a basis a <a href="SketchVergil.htm">block diagram</a>
constructed in Vergil.
The applet extends the Vergil implementation to make the
sketched source and the plotter share the same graphical object
on screen.</p>
