This model shows a polynomial mapping described by
the equation: x(n+1) = rx(n)(1-x(n)) which was 
originally introduced as a demographic model where
x(n) is a number between 0 and 1, and represents
the population at year n and r is a positive number,
and represents a combined rate for reproduction and
starvation. 

<p>It is often cited as an archetypal example of how
complex, chaotic behavior can arise from very simple
non-linear dynamical equations:
<ul>
<li> With 0, the population will eventually die.
<li> With 1, the population will quickly stabilize to
  (r-1)/r.
<li> With 2&lt;r&lt;3, the population will eventually stabilize 
  to (r-1)/r, after oscillating around that value for
  some time.
<li> With 3&lt;r&lt;3.45, the population will oscillate between
  2 values forever.
<li> With 3.45&lt;r&lt;3.54, the population will oscillate
  between 4 values.
<li> With r slightly bigger than 3.54, the population 
  will oscillate between 8 values, then 16, 32, etc.
  The lengths of the parameter intervals which yield
  the same number of oscillations decrease rapidly...
<li> At r = 3.57 is the onset of chaos and we can no
  longer see any oscillations.
</ul>
