<h1>LogisticMap</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>This model shows a polynomial mapping described by 
the equation: x(n+1) = rx(n)(1-x(n)) which was  
originally introduced as a demographic model where 
x(n) is a number between 0 and 1, and represents 
the population at year n and r is a positive number, 
and represents a combined rate for reproduction and 
starvation. 

<p>It is often cited as an archetypal example of how
complex, chaotic behavior can arise from very simple
non-linear dynamical equations:
<ul>
<li> With 0<r<1, the population will eventually die.
<li> With 1<r<2, the population will quickly stabilize to
(r-1)/r.
<li> With 2<r<3, the population will eventually stabilize 
to (r-1)/r, after oscillating around that value for
some time.
<li> With 3<r<3.45, the population will oscillate between
2 values forever.
<li> With 3.45<r<3.54, the population will oscillate
between 4 values.
<li> With r slightly bigger than 3.54, the population 
will oscillate between 8 values, then 16, 32, etc.
The lengths of the parameter intervals which yield
the same number of oscillations decrease rapidly...
<li> At r = 3.57 is the onset of chaos and we can no
longer see any oscillations.
</ul>
