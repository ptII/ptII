} {{ptolemy.actor.sched.NotSchedulableException: Actors remain that cannot be scheduled!

Note that there are many reasons why a graph cannot be scheduled:
* SDF Graphs with feedback loops should have an actor with a delay in the loop, such as a SampleDelay.* The SDF director has an "allowDisconnectedGraphs"parameter, which, when true, permits disconnected SDF graphs.
* The token consumption rate and production rates might be mismatched.  Usually, actors produce one token or consume one token on a port.  To produce or consume multiple tokens per firing, add a "tokenConsumptionRate" or "tokenConsumptionRate" parameter to the appropriate port.
