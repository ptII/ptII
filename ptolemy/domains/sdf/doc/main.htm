<h1>Synchronous Dataflow</h1>
<P>
Synchronous dataflow (SDF) is a special case of dataflow
where the flow of control is sufficiently regular to be
completely predictable at compile time.
An SDF model is an interconnection of actors whose
firings are enabled by fixed, pre-specified numbers of
tokens on each of their inputs.  Moreover, when an actor
fires, it produces a fixed, pre-specified number of tokens
on each of its outputs.
The fact that these numbers are fixed makes it possible for
a scheduler to determine the firing sequence at the time
the model is initialized.  Thus, SDF models are quite efficient,
in that there is no multithreading needed, and run-time overhead
consists only of a very
simple dispatcher that implements the pre-computed
schedule.
