////BufferingProfile

/**
<h1>Class comments</h1>
BufferingProfile is an interface which when implemented by SDF actors
Lets the OptimizingSDFDirector choose from different firings with different properties
For now there are two firing modes define, one where the actor may assume it has 
exclusive access to the information encapsulated by the input tokens. In particular, 
this is used for models where tokens communicate references to shared data structures
such as video frames in image processing.
In the alternative firing mode, the actor may not assume exclusive access and hence is
not allowed to modify the frame.It may have to copy the frame first instead. 

FIXME: we may want to generalize the notion of a profile to make it more generic and allow
more than two modes of firing.
