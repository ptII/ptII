/**
 *
 * Record an initial token and then output that initial token during
 * initialize(), then pass through.
 *
 * <p>The BootstrapSampleDelay works in the same way as a regular
 * sample delay actor, but with the added feature that it records the
 * initial value passed into it and will send that value out as the
 * initial value on the next run.</p>
 *
 * <p>Frequently, sample delays are placed as dependency loop-breakers
 * so that a model can run, but their default value of {0} is
 * undesirable. This is commonly fixed by examining the first value
 * passed into the sample delay and either setting the sample delay's
 * starting value to this value; or recording that value in a
 * parameter within the same container as the sample delay and setting
 * the sample delay's starting value to reference the parameter.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Bootstrap sample delay internalizes the above solutions and
 * furthermore needs no additional manual upkeep should starting
 * values change.
