/**
 Director for the synchronous dataflow (SDF) model of computation.

 <h1>SDF overview</h1>
 The Synchronous Dataflow(SDF) domain supports the efficient
 execution of Dataflow graphs that
 lack control structures.   Dataflow graphs that contain control structures
 should be executed using the Process Networks(PN) domain instead.
 SDF allows efficient execution, with very little overhead at runtime.  It
 requires that the rates on the ports of all actors be known before hand.
 SDF also requires that the rates on the ports not change during
 execution.  In addition, in some cases (namely systems with feedback) delays,
 which are represented by initial tokens on relations must be explicitly
 noted.  SDF uses this rate and delay information to determine
 the execution sequence of the actors before execution begins.
 <h2>Schedule Properties</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>The number of tokens accumulated on every relation is bounded, given
 an infinite number of executions of the schedule.</li>
 <li>Deadlock will never occur, given an infinite number of executions of
 the schedule.</li>
 </ul>
 <h1>Class comments</h1>
 An SDFDirector is the class that controls execution of actors under the
 SDF domain.  By default, actor scheduling is handled by the SDFScheduler
 class.  Furthermore, the newReceiver method creates Receivers of type
 SDFReceiver, which extends QueueReceiver to support optimized gets
 and puts of arrays of tokens.
 <p>
 Actors are assumed to consume and produce exactly one token per channel on
 each firing.  Actors that do not follow this convention should set
 the appropriate parameters on input and output ports to declare the number
 of tokens they produce or consume.  See the
 {@link ptolemy.domains.sdf.kernel.SDFScheduler} for more information.
 The {@link ptolemy.domains.sdf.lib.SampleDelay} actor is usually used
 in a model to specify the delay across a relation.
 </p><p>
 The <i>allowDisconnectedGraphs</i> parameter of this director determines
 whether disconnected graphs are permitted.
 A model may have two or more graphs of actors that
 are not connected.  The schedule can jump from one graph to
 another among the disconnected graphs. There is nothing to
 force the scheduler to finish executing all actors on one
 graph before firing actors on another graph. However, the
 order of execution within an graph should be correct.
 Usually, disconnected graphs in an SDF model indicates an
 error.
 The default value of the allowDisconnectedGraphs parameter is a
 BooleanToken with the value false.
 </p><p>
 The <i>iterations</i> parameter of this director corresponds to a
 limit on the number of times the director will fire its hierarchy
 before it returns false in postfire.  If this number is not greater
 than zero, then no limit is set and postfire will always return true.
 The default value of the iterations parameter is an IntToken with value zero.
 </p><p>
 If any actor's postfire() method returns false during an iteration,
 then at the conclusion of the iteration, this director's postfire() method
 will return false. This will normally result in termination of the execution.
 The reasoning for this behavior is that the model cannot continue executing
 without the participation of all actors, and if any actor returns false
 in postfire(), then it is indicating that it wishes to not continue executing.
 </p><p>
 The <i>vectorizationFactor</i> parameter of this director sets the number
 of times that the basic schedule is executed during each firing of this
 director.  This might allow the director to execute the model more efficiently,
 by combining multiple firings of each actor.  The default value of the
 vectorizationFactor parameter is an IntToken with value one.
 </p><p>
 The SDF director has a <i>period</i> parameter which specifies the
 amount of model time that elapses per iteration. If the value of
 <i>period</i> is 0.0 (the default), then it has no effect, and
 this director never increments time nor calls fireAt() on the
 enclosing director. If the period is greater than 0.0, then
 if this director is at the top level, it increments
 time by this amount in each invocation of postfire().
 If it is not at the top level, then it calls
 fireAt(currentTime + period) in postfire().
 </p><p>
 This behavior gives an interesting use of SDF within DE:
 You can "kick start" an SDF submodel with a single
 event, and then if the director of that SDF submodel
 has a period greater than 0.0, then it will continue to fire
 periodically with the specified period.
 </p><p>
 If <i>period</i> is greater than 0.0 and the parameter
 <i>synchronizeToRealTime</i> is set to <code>true</code>,
 then the prefire() method stalls until the real time elapsed
 since the model started matches the period multiplied by
 the iteration count.
 This ensures that the director does not get ahead of real time. However,
 of course, this does not ensure that the director keeps up with real time.
