//// SDFScheduler

/**

 A scheduler that implements basic scheduling of SDF graphs.  This
 class calculates the SDF schedule in two phases.  First, the balance
 equations for the rates between actors are solved to determine the
 <i>firing vector</i> (also known as the repetitions vector).  The
 firing vector is the least integer solution such that the number of
 tokens created on each channel of each relation is equal to the number
 of tokens consumed.  In some cases, no solution exists.  Such graphs
 are not executable under SDF.
 <p>
 Then the actors are ordered such that each actor only fires when the
 scheduler has determined that enough tokens will be present on its
 input ports to allow it to fire.  In cases where the dataflow graph is
 cyclic, a valid firing vector exists, but no actor can fire, since
 they all depend on the output of another actor.  This situation is
 known as <i>deadlock</i>.  Deadlock must be prevented in SDF by manually
 inserting delay actors, which represent initial tokens on each
 relation.  Such delay actors are responsible for creating tokens
 during initialization that will prevent deadlock.  These actors
 set the <i>tokenInitProduction</i> parameter of their output ports
 to represent the number of
 tokens they will create during initialization.  The SDFScheduler uses
 this parameter to break the dependency in a cyclic
 graph.
 <p>
 Note that this scheduler only ensures that the number of firings is
 minimal.  Most notably, it does not attempt to minimize the size of
 the buffers that are associated with each relation.  The resulting
 schedule is a linear schedule (as opposed to a looped schedule) and is
 not suitable for multiprocessing environments.
 <p>
 Any actors may be
 scheduled by this scheduler, which will, by default, assume
 homogeneous behavior for each actor.  (i.e. each output port produces
 one token for each firing, and each input port consumes one token on
 each firing, and no tokens are created during initialization.)  If
 this is not the case then parameters named <i>tokenConsumptionRate</i>,
 <i>tokenProductionRate</i>, and <i>tokenInitProduction</i> must be set.
 The SDFIOPort class provides easier access to these parameters.
 <p>
 Note that reconstructing the schedule is expensive, so the schedule is
 locally cached for as long as possible, and mutations under SDF should
 be avoided.
 <p>
 Note that this scheduler supports actors with 0-rate ports as long as
 the graph is not equivalent to a disconnected graph. This scheduler
 is somewhat conservative in this respect.
 <p>Disconnected graphs are supported if the SDF Director parameter
 <i>allowDisconnectedGraphs</i> is true.
