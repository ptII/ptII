<h1>Finite State Machine Domain</h1>
<P>
The Finite State Machine (FSM) domain implements hierarchical extended
finite state machine [1] in Ptolemy II. FSM is a very intuitive and
well-understood tool to model and specify discrete control logic. In
this domain, states of an FSM can be hierarchically clustered to help
specifying complex control logic. When modeling a control component in
a large system, the FSM model constructed in this domain can be embedded
in other domains in which the rest of the system are modeled.
<P>
When modeling a modal system, states of an FSM model can be refined by
subsystems in other domains, e.g. CT and DE. The behavior of this model
is the behavior of its current subsystem (the subsystem refining its
current state) plus state transitions triggered by external events
or events detected in the current subsystem.

<p>The <code>fsm</code> domain is for use with the <a href="../../ct/doc/body.htm" target="body"><code>ct</code></a> domain.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../modal/doc/body.htm" target="body"><code>modal</code></a> domain is for use with the <a href="../../continuous/doc/body.htm" target="body"><code>continuous</code></a> domain.</p>

<p>The FSM domain is no longer being developed, please use the Modal domain instead.
