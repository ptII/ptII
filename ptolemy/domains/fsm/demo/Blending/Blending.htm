<P> A blending controller with two major control modes.


 <!-- All of the controls of the applet should be visible when the
applet is displayed on a XGA screen-->
<!-- PT DEPLOYJAVA CONVERTER -->
<p>
Blending is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "Blending.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="BlendingVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>The blending controller has two major control modes, implemented by
controllers A and B inside. When the control mode changes from A to B,
the transition is smoothed by a blending component. This is achieved
by letting the "A to B" state of the mode controller (inside the blending
controller) be refined by three components: Controller_A, Controller_B,
and Blending_A_to_B. The mode change from B to A is managed
symmetrically.</p>
