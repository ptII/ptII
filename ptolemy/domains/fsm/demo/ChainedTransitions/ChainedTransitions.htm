<P>
This model shows how Ptolemy II handles the "chained" transitions.

<p>By chained transitions, it means that when a state is entered through
an incoming transition, at least one of its outgoing transitions is 
enabled, and the enabled transition is taken immediately without 
advancing the time. The state is called a "transient" state.

<p>Note, the actions associated with both the incoming and outgoing 
transitions are executed.

<p>The <a href="ChainedTransitionsVergil.htm">block diagram</a>
for the model was constructed using the Ptolemy II schematic editor
called Vergil.
