//// TransitionRefinement

/**

 Transition refinements provide a way to use composite actors which are run
 whenever a transition is taken in an FSM modal, much in the same way
 that State refinements are run every time an FSM is in a particular state.
 This provides an alternative mechanism for performing calculations during
 a Transition other than expressions in the Set Actions and Output Actions
 of that Transition. The expression actions are still executed but only
 after the Transition refinement has been fired.<p>

 This typed composite actor supports mirroring of its ports in its
 container (which is required to be a ModalModel), which in turn assures
 mirroring of ports in each of the refinements and the controller.
 TransitionRefinement fulfills the CTStepSizeControlActor interface so that
 it can be used to construct hybrid systems using the CT domain.<p>
