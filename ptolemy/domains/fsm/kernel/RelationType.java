////RelationType

/**
 A static class contains a list of types for relation node. There are six
 different types:
 <pre>
 INVALID
 TRUE
 FALSE
 EQUAL_INEQUAL
 LESS_THAN
 GREATER_THAN
 </pre>
 <p>
 For a leaf node evaluated as a boolean token, its relationType is
 decided by the boolean value of the result boolean token: TRUE for
 true and FALSE for false.
 <p>
 For a relation node, (scalarLeft
 relationOperator scalarRight), the relationType depends on the
 relationOperator. If the relationOperator is '==' or '!=', the
 relationType can be EQUAL_INEQUAL indicating the two scalars equal or
 not equal; the relation type is LESS_THAN to indicate that the left scalar
 is less than the right one, and GREATER_THAN to
 indicate left scalar is bigger than the right one. For the other kinds of
 relation operators, the relationType is decided by the boolean value of
 the evaluation result, i.e., TRUE for true and FALSE for false.
 <p>
 The INVALID type is for a relation not evaluated yet.
