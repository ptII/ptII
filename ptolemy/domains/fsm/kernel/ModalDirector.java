/**
 An ModalDirector governs the execution of a modal model. A modal model is
 a TypedCompositeActor with a ModalDirector as local director. The mode
 control logic is captured by a mode controller, an instance of FSMActor
 contained by the composite actor. Each state of the mode controller
 represents a mode of operation and can be refined by an opaque CompositeActor
 contained by the same composite actor.
 <p>
 This class differs from its base class in that it strictly follows the
 actor semantics. It does not invoke the postfire() method of any actors
 under its control until its own postfire() method is called. Thus,
 if those actors also follow the actor semantics, then no persistent
 changes are made in the prefire() or fire() methods.
 <p>
 When a modal model is fired, this director first transfers the input tokens
 from the outside domain to the mode controller and the refinement of its
 current state. The preemptive transitions from the current state of the mode
 controller are examined. If there is more than one transition enabled, and
 any of the enabled transitions is not marked nondeterministic, an
 exception is thrown. If there is exactly one preemptive transition enabled
 then it is chosen. The choice actions (outputActions) contained by the transition are
 executed. Any output token produced by the mode controller is transferred to
 both the output ports of the modal model and the input ports of the mode
 controller. Then the refinements associated with the enabled transition are
 fired. Any output token produced by the refinements is transferred to
 both the output ports of the modal model and the input ports of the mode
 controller. The refinements of the current state will not be fired.
 <p>
 If no preemptive transition is enabled, the refinements of the current state
 are fired. Any output token produced by the refinements is transferred to
 both the output ports of the modal model and the input ports of the mode
 controller. After this, the non-preemptive transitions from the current
 state of the mode controller are examined. If there is more than one
 transition enabled, and any of the enabled transitions is not marked
 nondeterministic, an exception is thrown. If there is exactly one
 non-preemptive transition enabled then it is chosen and the choice actions
 contained by the transition are executed. Any output token produced by the
 mode controller is transferred to the output ports of the modal model and
 the input ports of the mode controller. Then, the refinements of the
 enabled transition are executed. Any output token produced by the refinements
 is transferred to both the output ports of the modal model and the input
 ports of the mode controller.
 <p>
 At the end of one firing, the modal model transfers its outputs to the outside
 model. The mode controller does not change state during successive firings
 in one iteration of the top level in order to support upper level domains
 that iterate to a fixed point.
 <p>
 When the modal model is postfired, the chosen transition of the latest
 firing is committed. The commit actions contained by the transition are
 executed and the current state of the mode controller is set to the
 destination state of the transition.
