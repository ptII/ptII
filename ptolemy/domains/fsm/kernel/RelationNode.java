/**
 An instance of the RelationNode class stores the type and difference
 information of a relation. For more details of type, see {@link RelationType}.
 For more details of difference, see
 {@link ptolemy.domains.fsm.kernel.ParseTreeEvaluatorForGuardExpression}.
 The instance stores the information of two evaluations of the transition,
 the current evaluation and the previous evaluaiton.
