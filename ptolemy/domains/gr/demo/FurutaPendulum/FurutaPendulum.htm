<H1>FurutaPendulum</H1>

The Furuta pendulum has a motor controlling the angle of an arm, from
which a free-swinging pendulum hangs.  The objective is to swing the
pendulum up and then balance it.

applet is displayed on a XGA screen-->

FurutaPendulum is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "FurutaPendulum.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="FurutaPendulumVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<h3>Execution</h3>
An execution of the model displays various signals and at the bottom produces a 3-D animation of the physical system. 

<br>Model by Johan Eker

<h3>Top-Level Model</h3> 


The top-level is a continuous-time model that specifies the dynamics
of the physical system as a set of nonlinear ordinary differential
equations, and encapsulates a closed loop controller.


Framework by Jie Liu


<h3>Higher-Order Components</h3>

Complex submodels are generated automatically from equations
describing the physical dynamics.


<br>Framework by Jie Liu

<h3>A Modal Controller</h3>

The controller itself is modal, with three modes of operation, where a
different control law is specified for each mode.


<br>Framework by Xiaojun Liu


<h3>The Discrete Controllers</h3>

Three discrete submodels (dataflow models) specify control laws for
each of three modes of operation.
<br>Framework by Steve Neuendorffer


<h3>The Graphical Animator</h3>

A 3-D graphical animation is constructed modularly as a parametric
scene graph that is driven by the physical model.
