<h1>GR</h1>


The GR domain is an experimental domain designed for three dimensional
graphical animations. It is an untimed domain with particular
optimizations aimed at reducing recomputations of scene graph components.
A model consists of a set of three dimensional graphical elements, such
as spheres, cylinders, etc., composed and transformed to form a scene
graph. It is particularly interesting and useful to couple this domain
with others, where the other domains provide the transformations for
the graphical elements. For example, a model of a physical system might be
constructed in CT and animated in GR.

<h2>Java3D</h2>
The GR domain demos require Java3D, which can be installed 
 <!-- #in_browser causes HTMLViewer to spawn a separate browser -->

<a href="http://java3d.dev.java.net/#in_browser" target="_top"><CODE>http://java3d.dev.java.net/</CODE></a>.

You need not install Java3d if you are not planning on using GR domain.

 <p>If you plan on recompiling the GR domain, then install the Java 3D SDK
and runtime.  If you plan on only running the GR domain demos, then
installing only the Java 3D runtime should be sufficient.
We have verified the demos with the 
<code>java3d-1_5_1-windows-i586.exe</code> installer.
 from <a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/#in_browser" target="_top"><CODE>https://java3d.dev.java.net/</CODE></a>.

 <p>If you are running Ptolemy II under Web Start, see
<a href="../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm#Java3D">Installing Java 3D for use with Web Start</a>

 <p>If, when you run the GR domain demos, you get a message
about <CODE>d3d8.dll</CODE> missing, then you probably need to install
DirectX.
 <br>DirectX can be downloaded from

<h3>Running Java 3D Applets under Windows</h3>

<ol>
 <!-- #in_browser causes HTMLViewer to spawn a separate browser -->
<li>Install Java 3D from <a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/#in_browser" target="_top"><CODE>https://java3d.dev.java.net/</CODE></a>.

<br>We have verified the demos with the Java 3D 1.2.1_04 SDK (DirectX Version).
<br>The installation should update the Java Runtime Environment
that the browser uses.

<li>The Java 3D SDK installation includes demonstrations that can
be run from your browser.
<br>Under Windows, go to the <code>demo/java3d</code> subdirectory
in your JDK directory, for example
<a href="file:///C|/j2sdk1.4.2_04/demo/java3d/index.html#in_browser" target="_top"><code>file:///C|/j2sdk1.4.2_04/demo/java3d/index.html</code></a>
and run the HelloUniverse demo

 <!-- #in_browser causes HTMLViewer to spawn a separate browser -->

<br>If you can't find the demos on your local disk, try
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/#Examples#in_browser"><code>https://java3d.dev.java.net/#Examples</code></a>

<li>If the demo fails to run, look in the Java Plugin console window.
If you get a message like
<pre>
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/media/j3d/SceneGraphObject
</pre>
Then be sure that the Java 3D jar files (j3daudio.jar, j3dcore.jar,
j3dutils.jar,vecmath.jar) are located in the lib/ext directory for the plugin.

<br>The plugin is usually located in <code>c:/Program Files/javasoft/JRE</code>
and in theory the Java 3D installation should place the jar files, but
you may need to copy them by hand.

<pre>
cp c:/j2sdk1.4.2_04/jre/lib/ext/*  c:/Program\ Files/Java/j2re1.4.2_04/lib/ext
</pre>
You may also need to copy <code>J3D.dll</code>
<pre>
cp c:/j2sdk1.4.2_04/jre/bin/J3D.dll  c:/Program\ Files/Java/j2re1.4.2_04/bin
</pre>
