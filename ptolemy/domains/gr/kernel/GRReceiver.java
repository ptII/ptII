/**
 The receiver for the GR domain. This receiver is a mailbox with capacity one,
 and any token put in the receiver overwrites any token previously present in
 the receiver. As a consequence, the hasRoom() method always returns true. The
 get() method will consume the token if there exists one. After the
 consumption, the hasToken() method will return false, until a token is put
 into this receiver.
