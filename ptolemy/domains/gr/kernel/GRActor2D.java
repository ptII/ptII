 A base class for all two-dimensional GR actors. These actors use Diva
 to render two-dimensional scenes in the GR domain. This is an abstract
 class that is never used as a standalone actor in a Ptolemy model.
 Subclasses of this actor include Geometry actors, Transform actors,
 Interaction actors, and the ViewScreen2D display actor.
