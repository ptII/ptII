/**
 GR is a domain for displaying three-dimensional graphics in Ptolemy
 II.  GR is an untimed domain in where actors are connected in an
 acyclic directed graph.  Actors are fired according to a simple
 topological sort of the graph.  Nodes in the graph that have no
 descendants are assumed to be consumers of data produced by the rest
 of the model.

 <p>The basic idea behind the GR domain is to arrange geometry and
 transform actors in a directed acyclic graph to represent the location
 and orientation of objects in a scene. This topology of connected GR
 actors form what is commonly called a scene graph in computer graphics
 literature.  The GR director converts the GR scene graph into a Java3D
 representation for rendering on the computer screen.
