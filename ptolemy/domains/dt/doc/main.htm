<h1>Discrete Time</h1>

The Discrete Time (DT) domain is a timed extension of the Synchronous Dataflow
(SDF) domain.  Like SDF, it has static scheduling of the dataflow graph
model. Likewise, DT requires that the rates on the ports of all actors be
known beforehand and fixed. DT handles feedback systems in the same way that
SDF does, but with additional constraints on initial tokens.
<p>
Because of the inherent concurrency occurring within SDF dataflow graph models,
there are two notions of time in DT -- global time and local time.  Global time
increases steadily as execution progresses.  Moreover, global time increments by
fixed discrete chunks of time based on the value of the <i>period</i> parameter.
On the other hand, local time applies to each of the actors in the model. All the
actors have distinct local times as an iteration proceeds. The local time of
an actor during an iteration depends on the global time, period, firing count,
port rates, and the schedule. These local times obey the following constraint:

<center>Global Time  <=  Local Time <= (Global Time + period)</center>

The exact way that local time increments during an iteration is described in
detail in the DTReceiver documentation.

<p>The DT domain is an experimental domain, the code has not
been reviewed, and the interfaces are likely to change.
