//// PtidesEvent

/** This class defines the structure of events in the Ptides domain.
 *  Conceptually, a Ptides event is the same as a DE event {@link DEEvent}.
 *  However, scheduling in Ptides is more flexible than in DE. In
 *  order to support this flexibility, fields such as token, receiver,
 *  and absoluteDeadline are added.
 *  <p>
 *  A Ptides event can be of two kinds. A pure event, or a non-pure
 *  (trigger) event. For all pure events, the absolute deadline of
 *  this event is saved. For all non-pure events, the token as well
 *  as the destination receiver is saved. These information are saved
 *  in addition to the information that is stored in the super class,
 *  such as the timestamp, etc. This class is used in the Ptides domain.
 *  <p>
 *  Note in PtidesEvent, unlike DEEvent, the ioPort parameter is overloaded.
 *  If the event is not a pure event, then ioPort indicate the destination
 *  port for this event. However, if the event is a pure event, then ioPort
 *  is the source input port for this event.
 *  <p>
 *  The semantics of equals() and compareTo() in this method are tricky.
 *  equals() indicates two Ptides events are equal if all fields in this
 *  class and the superclass are equal (including absoluteDeadline, token,
 *  channel, and receiver, etc).
 *  However, the compareTo() method does not override that of the super class.
 *  The semantics of the compareTo() is such that two events are equal
 *  if the timestamps, microstep, depth, and priority fields indicate they
 *  are equal. Note
 *  CompareTo() should be called by Ptides directors that try to order
 *  events based on event's timestamps.
 *  If the Ptides director wishes to order events based on deadlines, it
 *  should check event deadlines first. Only in the case when deadlines
 *  of events are equal, should compareTo() be called.
