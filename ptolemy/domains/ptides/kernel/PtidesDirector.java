/**
 * Top-level director for Ptides (= Programming Temporally Integrated
 * Distributed Systems) models. A Ptides model consists of platforms represented
 * by CompositeActors that communicate via events. Those platforms run in
 * threads. This director is a timed director, the time represents the global
 * <i>physical time</i>. This physical time is used in all platforms, for
 * sending events between platforms, a global bounded clock synchronization
 * error and a global bounded network delay is considered.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Platforms contain sensors, actuators, computation actors with worst case
 * execution times and model time delay actors. The execution of actors inside a
 * platform is governed by a director that executes events according to their
 * <i>model time</i> time stamps. This director can be either a DEDirector or
 * the PtidesEmbeddedDirector. The PtidesEmbeddedDirector is a smarter
 * DEDirector in the sense that it allows an out of time stamp order execution
 * of events. ??? Some actors inside a platform require a mapping of the model
 * time defined in event time stamps to physical time. Those actors are sensors
 * and actuators. Also, the execution of actors with a worst case execution time
 * > 0 is simulated which requires the simulation of physical time passing
 * between the start and the termination of an actor.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A platform executes events as long as there are events that are safe to
 * process and schedulable to process. Safe to process means that there is no
 * chance of an event arriving at the same port or port group with an earlier
 * time stamp. Whether an event is schedulable is determined by the platform
 * characteristics. For example, if the execution of an event would take longer
 * than the time until the next execution of an actuator and the platform cannot
 * preempt actor executions, this event cannot be executed.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When a platform has no more events safe and possible to process at the
 * current physical time, it schedules a refiring at a future physical time.
 * This platform calls the fireAt() method of this director which blocks the
 * platform. A platform is resumed when:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The physical time has been increased to the new physical time at which
 * the platform wanted to be refired or</li>
 * <li>Another platform sent an event to the platform. This event might be safe
 * to process, it is up to the platform to find that out.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Ptides model never terminates thus a stop time must be specified.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The difference between the PtidesDirector and a DE director with threads is
 * that the PtidesDirector does not call the fire of the contained actors, the
 * contained actors fire in an infinite loop. If there is nothing to fire, the
 * actor waits until the physical time of the PtidesDirector is increased.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The difference between the PtidesDirector and a PN, TimedPN or DDE director
 * is that there are no blocking writes or reads between actors. The only way an
 * actor can be blocked is because it waits for physical time to pass.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Usage: Every actor in a model controlled by the PtidesDirector must be a
 * CompositeActor containing a director that executes actors according to event
 * time stamps.
