/**
 * Receivers in the Ptides domain use a timed queue to sort events in
 * the receivers.
 * Tokens are stored in the receiver as a pair of token and tag, to help
 * methods such as hasToken() to indicate whether there is a token of the
 * requested tag. This receiver is needed because events can be processed
 * out of timestamp order, thus tokens are transmitted between actors out
 * of timestamp order. Some of this code is copied from PtidesReceiver written
 * by Patricia Derler, since we want to have a sorted list of events at each
 * receiver. However we still want to extend DEReceiver so that the structure
 * is uniform in that PtidesBasicDirector extends DEDirector, and PtidesBasicReceiver
 * extends DEReceiver.
