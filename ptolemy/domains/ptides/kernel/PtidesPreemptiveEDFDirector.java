/**
 *  This director implements preemptive PTIDES scheduling algorithm, and uses
 *  EDF as the foundation to determine whether we should preempt executing events.
 *  This director is different from PtidesBasicPreemptiveDDFDirector because that director
 *  only takes the first event and analyze it for safe to process, however this director
 *  looks at all events in the event queue, takes the one that is safe to process and has
 *  the smallest deadline. Here, deadline is calculated by summing timestamp with the
 *  relativeDeadline parameter as annotated by the user.
 *  <p>
 *  Notice this director has to use RealDependency, though all PTIDES directors should be
 *  using RealDependency. The reason it is used here is because safe to process relies on
 *  the correct ordering of depth in order to provide the correct answer, and
 *  BooleanDependency does not return the correct value for depth.
