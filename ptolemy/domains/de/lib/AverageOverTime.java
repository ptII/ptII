/**
 An actor to compute the average of the input values received so far over model
 time. This actor can fire whenever there is a token at its input port, or the
 model time has advanced since last firing. It records the last token that it
 received. In each firing, the produce of the last token and the amount of model
 time increment is added to a sum variable. The average value received so far is
 obtained by dividing the sum by the current model time. This average is sent to
 the output port in each firing. If a token is available at the input port, this
 actor reads that token and overwrites the last token with it.
