//// WaitingTime

/**
 This actor measures the time that events at one input have to wait for
 events at another.  Specifically, there will be one output event for
 each <i>waiter</i> input event.  But the output event is delayed until the
 next arrival of an event at <i>waitee</i>.  When one or more events arrive
 at <i>waitee</i>, then all events that have arrived at <i>waiter</i> since
 the last <i>waitee</i> (or since the start of the execution) trigger an
 output.  The value of each output is the time that the <i>waiter</i> event
 waited for <i>waitee</i>.  The inputs have undeclared type, so anything
 is acceptable.  The output is always a DoubleToken.
