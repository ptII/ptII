/**
 A queue that outputs the next token to an output channel that is ready to
 receive it. It can have multiple output channels, and the same number of
 trigger channels. Initially all output channels are assumed to be ready. When a
 token is available, it is sent to the first channel that is ready, and that
 channel is marked not ready. When all channels are not ready, the token would
 be queued. If the number of tokens already in the queue is equal to the queue
 capacity (0 means infinity), then new tokens are lost.
 <p>
 To make an output channel ready after a token is sent to it, a triggering
 signal needs to be received in the corresponding channel of the trigger port.
