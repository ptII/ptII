//// Derivative

/**
 Output the discrete derivative of the input, y[n] = (x[n] - x[n-1])/dt,
 where <i>dt</i> is the time gap between input events. Output is not generated
 until two inputs have been consumed.
 <p>
 The output of this actor is constrained to be a double, and input must be castable 
 to a double. If the input signal is not left-continuous, the derivative will be either
 infinite or undefined and an exception is thrown.
 <p>
 In postfire(), if an event is present on the <i>reset</i> port, this
 actor resets to its initial state, and will not output until two
 subsequent inputs have been consumed.  This is useful if the input signal is
 switched on and off, in which case the time gap between events becomes large
 and would otherwise effect the value of the derivative for one sample.
