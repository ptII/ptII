//// NonInterruptibleTimer

/**
 A NonInterruptibleTimer actor works similar to the {@link Timer} actor,
 except that if a NonInterruptibleTimer actor has not finished processing
 the previous input, a new input has to be delayed for processing.
 In other words, it can not be interrupted to respond new inputs. Instead,
 the new inputs will be queued and processed in a first come first serve
 (FCFS) fashion. This actor extends the Timer actor.
 <p>
 The key difference between the NonInterruptibleTimer actor and the Server
 actor is how the service time is specified.  In the NonInterruptibleTimer
 actor, whenever an input arrives, the value of the input token specifies
 the service time.  This actor will guarantee that much service time to be
 given to that input.  In the Server actor, service times for inputs ar
 decided by the ServiceTime parameter, which may change any time during an
 execution. In particular, how much service time an input actually gets is
 decided the value of the ServiceTime parameter at the time the server is
 ready to serve that input.
