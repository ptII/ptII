/** Output the discrete integral of the input. Inputs are multiplied by the time
 *  gap from the previous input and accumulated. Output is not generated
 *   until two inputs have been consumed.
 *  <p>
 *  The output type of this actor is forced to be double.
 *  <p>
 *  In postfire(), if an event is present on the <i>reset</i> port, this
 *  actor resets to its initial state, and will not output until two
 *  subsequent inputs have been consumed.  This is useful if the input signal is
 *  switched on and off, in which case the time gap between events becomes large
 *  and would otherwise effect the value of the integral.
 *  <p>
 *  The integrator performs linear interpolation between input events,
 *  where the output of the integrator follows the equation
 *  y[n] = y[n-1] + (x[n-1] + x[n])*dt/2 where <i>dt</i> is the time
 *  differential between events. This equates to the trapezoidal method of
 *  approximating a Riemann integral.
