/**
 A DE actor to compare the time stamps of events at its two input ports, and
 output the difference. Every time an event can be processed either at input
 port <code>input1</code> or at <code>input2</code>, the event is consumed. The
 value that the event carries is insignificant, but the time stamp of the event
 is recorded in a local list. Time stamps received at the two input ports are
 stored in two different lists. Every time when both lists have data, the
 difference between the top elements of the lists is obtained, and is sent to
 the output port. This done by subtracting the time stamp of every top event in
 the list for <code>input2</code> with the time stamp of every top event in the
 list for <code>input1</code>.
 <p>
 This actor could potentially consume an infinite amount of memory if the
 arrival rates of events at the two input ports are different, because one of
 the lists keeps growing.
