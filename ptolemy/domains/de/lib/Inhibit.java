/**
 Output a received input token, unless the <i>inhibit</i> port receives a
 token at the same time.  If no token has been received on the <i>input</i>
 port when a token is received on the <i>inhibit</i> port, then no output is
 produced.  The inputs can be of any token type, and the output
 is constrained to be of a type at least that of the input.
 <p>
 Both the <i>input</i> port and the <i>output</i> port are multiports.
 Generally, their widths should match. Otherwise, if the width of the
 <i>input</i> is greater than
 the width of the <i>output</i>, the extra input tokens will
 not appear on any output, although they will be consumed from
 the input port. If the width of the <i>output</i> is greater
 than that of the <i>input</i>, then the last few
 channels of the <i>output</i> will never emit tokens.
 <p>
 This actor is similar to the Sampler actor in that it modifies a
 stream of events based on the presence or absence of events from another
 input.  This actor reacts to the absence of the other event, whereas
 Sampler reacts to the presence of it.
