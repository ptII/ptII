//// TimedDelay

/**
 This actor delays the input by a specified amount of time. The amount
 of the time is required to be non-negative and has a default value 1.0.
 The input and output types are unconstrained, except that the output type
 must be the same as that of the input.
 <p>
 This actor keeps a local FIFO queue to store all received but not processed
 inputs. The behavior of this actor on each firing is to read a token from
 the input, if there is one, store it into the local queue, and output the
 previously received token that is scheduled to be produced at the current
 time.
 <p> During the postfire() method, this actor schedules itself to fire again
 to produce the just received token on the corresponding output channel after
 the appropriate time delay. Note that if the value of delay is 0.0, the
 actor schedules itself to fire at the current model time.
 <p>
 Occasionally, this actor is useful with the
 delay parameter set to 0.0.  The time stamp of the output will
 equal that of the input, but there is a "microstep" delay.
 The discrete-event domain in Ptolemy II has a "super dense" model
 of time, meaning that a signal from one actor to another can
 contain multiple events with the same time stamp. These events
 are "simultaneous," but nonetheless
 have a well-defined sequential ordering determined by the order
 in which they are produced.
 If \textit{delay} is 0.0, then the fire() method of this actor
 always produces on its output port the event consumed in the
 \textit{previous iteration} with the same time stamp, if there
 was one. If there wasn't such a previous iteration, then it
 produces no output.  Its postfire() method consumes and
 records the input for use in the next iteration, if there
 is such an input, and also requests a refiring at the current
 time.  This refire request triggers the next iteration (at
 the same time stamp), on which the output is produced.
 <p>
 A consequence of this strategy is that this actor is
 able to produce an output (or assert that there is no output) before the
 input with the same time is known.   Hence, it can be used to break
 causality loops in feedback systems. The DE director will leverage this when
 determining the precedences of the actors. It is sometimes useful to think
 of this zero-valued delay as an infinitesimal delay.
