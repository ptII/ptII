/**
 This interface defines an event queue used by DE directors to sort and
 manage DE events.
 <p>
 DE events are sorted according to their timestamps, microsteps, and then the
 depths of the destination actors. One DE event is said to be earlier than
 another, if it has a smaller timestamp, or when the timestamps are
 identical, it has a smaller microstep, or when both time stamps and
 microsteps are identical, it has a smaller depth. If all three entries are
 identical, then these two DE events are called identical.
 <p>
 This interface defines a few methods to manage the event queue, including
 adding a new event into the queue, getting the earliest event of the queue.
 A correct implementation of this interface should not allow identical
 events. In particular, when adding a new event, the event is not added if
 the event is already in the queue. Also note that calling the get() method
 does not delete events from event queue but calling the take() method does.
