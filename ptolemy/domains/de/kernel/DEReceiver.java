//// DEReceiver

/** An implementation of the ptolemy.actor.Receiver interface for the
 DE domain.
 <p>
 The put() method stores the given token in this receiver and posts a
 trigger event to the director. The director is responsible to dequeue that
 trigger event and invoke the actor that contains this receiver.
 The get() method returns the first available token from the receiver.
 <p>
 Before firing an actor, the director is expected to put at least one
 token into at least one of the receivers contained by the actor.
