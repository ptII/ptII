/**
 The base class for actors specific to the DE domain. This class
 implements both SequenceActor and TimedActor.
 <p>
 A DE domain-specific actor, like the
 {@link ptolemy.domains.de.lib.TimedDelay} actor, needs to extend this
 class. However, it does not mean only actors extending this class can
 be used in the DE domain. For example, the {@link ptolemy.actor.lib.Clock}
 actor can be used in DE domain.
