/**
 This class defines the structure of events in the DE domain.
 Conceptually, a DE event is a trigger that contains a tag and a reference to
 its destination actor. The purpose of a DE event is to schedule its
 destination actor to fire at the timestamp and microstep specified by
 its tag.
 <p>
 A tag is a tuple of a timestamp and a microstep. The timestamp is the model
 time when the event exists. The microstep defines the order of a sequence
 of (simultaneous) events that exist at the same model time.
 <p>
 A DE event is associated with a destination, which is either an actor or
 an IO port of an actor. A DE event, whose destination is an actor, is
 called a <i>pure</i> event. A pure event does not have a destination IO
 port. A DE event, whose destination is an IO port, is called a
 <i>trigger</i> event. A trigger event has a destination actor, which is
 the container of the destination IO port.
 <p>
 A DE event also has a depth, which is the topology information of its
 destinations. For a pure event, the depth is that of its destination actor.
 For a trigger event, the depth is that of its destination IO port. A larger
 value of depth indicates a lower priority when the simulator processes
 events with the same tag.
 <p>
 Two DE events can be compared to see which one happens first. The order
 is defined by the relationship between their time stamps, microsteps, and
 depths. See {@link DEEventQueue} for more details. DE events can be compared
 by using the compareTo() method.
 <p>
 This class is final to improve the simulation performance because new
 events get created and discarded through the whole simulation.
