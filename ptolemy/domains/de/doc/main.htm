<h1>Discrete Event</h1>
<P>
The Ptolemy II Discrete Event (DE) domain provides a general environment for
time-oriented simulations of systems such as queueing systems, communication
networks, and hardware systems. In this domain, actors communicate by sending
tokens across connections. The token sent and the time at which the action
took place constitute an event in the DE domain. Upon receiving an event, the
destination actor is activated and a reaction take place. The reaction may
change the internal state of the actor and possibly generate new events,
resulting in further reactions. A DE domain scheduler ensures that events
are processed chronologically.
