RealTimeComposite is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "RealTimeComposite.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="RealTimeCompositeVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>Here, the RealTimeComposite actor
has delay set to UNDEFINED, and we
use the triggering mechanism of the
Clock actor to throttle model time. 
Notice however that this mechanism 
will fail if there is any other 
open-loop part of the model (e.g. 
an untriggered Clock actor) because 
model time will get very far ahead 
very quickly. The time stamps of 
the outputs from the RealTimeComposite
become large quickly.</p>
