AssemblyLine is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "AssemblyLine.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="AssemblyLineVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>This demo shows how to use the NonInterruptibleTimer actor and Pulse actor to
model an assembly line.

<p>The Clock actor (Jobs) generates a set of jobs at different times, where no two
jobs happen at the same time. The Pulse actor (ServiceTimes) takes a job 
request and produces the service time of the job request. </p>

<p>The NonInterruptibleTimer actor (Station) takes the service time and sets a
timer. The timer goes off when the service time expires. The timer can not
be interrupted to respond to another input when it is running. </p>

<p>A job is passed along all three stations. The Plotter monitors the outputs
from Stations plots the times when jobs leaves the station.</p>

<p>This model is based on the assembly line example described in "Distributed 
Discrete-Event Simulation" by Jayadev Misra, Computer Surveys, Vol. 18, 
No. 1, March 1986.</p>
