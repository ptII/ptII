<h1>LongRuns</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>This model illustrates that time in Ptolemy II is unbounded.
This model can be run forever, beyond the point where time can
be resolved as a double relative to the time precision (1E-10).
In principle, it can even be run beyond the point where the
double representation of time is larger than what can be
represented in a double, although it would take a truly long
time to prove this. Note that the time gap that is reported
remains accurate regardless of how large time gets.</p>
