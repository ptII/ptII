<H1>FFT</H1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>This model shows the use of background process for long running tasks in 
the TM domain. There are two composite actors in this model, both 
implemented in SDF. One of them, the signal generator, has a short
execution time, and is treated as an atomic execution. The other, 
implementing the FFT algorithm, has a long execution time, and is 
executed in a separate thread.</p>
