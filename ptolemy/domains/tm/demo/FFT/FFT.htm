FFT is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "FFT.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="FFTVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>This model shows the use of background process for long running tasks in 
the TM domain. There are two composite actors in this model, both 
implemented in SDF. One of them, the signal generator, has a short
execution time, and is treated as an atomic execution. The other, 
implementing the FFT algorithm, has a long execution time, and is 
executed in a separate thread.</p>
