//// TMReceiver

/**
 The receiver for the TM domain. This receiver contains a FIFO queue.
 Upon receiving a token, it creates a TMEvent. The properties of the
 TM events are:
 <ul>
 <li> The destination receiver is this receiver.
 <li> The destination actor is the container's container of this receiver.
 <li> The token is the received token.
 <li> The priority is the value of the parameter with name <i>priority</i>
 of the container of this receiver. If the container does not has a
 parameter with that name, then look at the actor. If none of them
 has the parameter, then use the default priority value, which is
 java.Thread.NORMAL_PRIORITY.
 <li> The flag <i>hasStarted</i> is false.
 <li> The processing time is obtained from the container or the container's
 container of this receiver, similar to the way obtaining the priority
 value. If none of them has the parameter, then use the default value 0.
 </ul>
 The event is then queued with the director, so it is not immediately
 available by the get() method. Later, the director may make the
 token available again by calling the _triggerEvent() method.
 See the TMDirector class for the event dispatching mechanism.
