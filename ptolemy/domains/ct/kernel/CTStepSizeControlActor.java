/**
 Interface for actors that control integration step sizes for handling
 unpredictable breakpoints or controlling local truncation error when
 resolving states. Typically, actors that implement this interface are
 event detectors and dynamic actors.
 <P>
 Actors can affect the integration step size in two ways. The first one
 is by introducing predictable breakpoints. For example, when the fireAt()
 method of CTDirector is called with an argument <i>t</i>,
 the CTDirector will treat <i>t</i> as a breakpoint. Actors that only
 introduce predictable breakpoints need not implement this interface.
 <P>
 The second way of controlling step size is through checking the accuracy
 after each integration step. We treat an integration step accurate if
 the numerical integration error is less than the error tolerance and
 there is no (unpredictable) breakpoints within this step.
 Actors that use this mechanism need to implement this interface.
 At the end of each integration step, each CTStepSizeControlActor
 will be asked whether this step is accurate by calling its
 isOutputAccurate() or isStateAccurate() method. If either method returns
 false, that actor will then be asked to suggest a refined step size. If
 there are more than one actor finds that this step is not accurate, then the
 smallest of the suggested steps size will be used by the director to restart
 the integration step.
 <p>
 If all step size control actors find the integration step accurate,
 then they will be asked for a (predicted) next step size.
 The smallest predicted next step size will be used for the next
 integration step.
 <P>
 If there are no step size control actors in a model, the step size
 is controlled by the director.  Most (or possibly all) CT directors
 will leave the default step size at its initial value and only deviate
 from these steps when there is a predictable breakpoint that does not
 coincide with one of these steps.
