/**
 A CTDirector that uses multiple ODE solvers. The reason for using different
 solvers is that we need to handle both normal integration of ODEs over a
 time interval and abrupt changes in signals (or actors' functions) that
 happen at discrete time points.
 <p>
 At the time points where abrupt changes happen, a special ODE solver, called
 <i>breakpointODESolver</i>, is used. Typically, breakpointODESolver does not
 advance time. The job for a breakpointODESolver is to find the states of
 the system at a breakpoint. Usually, the system has more than one state at
 such time points, which is also known as discontinuities. We call the first
 state at a discontinuity the <i>initial</i> state, and the last state the
 <i>final</i> state. Therefore, a breakpointODESolver is responsible to
 resolve the final state of a discontinuity from the inputs and the initial
 states.
 <p>
 The following paper gives a detailed explanation of initial and final states
 and how the initial and final states are resolved.

 Workshop, HSCC, LNCS 3414, Zurich, Switzerland, March 9-11, 2005</a></ul>
 <p>
 This director handles both predictable breakpoints, whose appearance can be
 assured before reaching the time points they happen, and unpredictable
 breakpoints, whose appearance is unknown before the simulation passes the
 time points they happen.
 <P>
 This director can only be a top-level director. For a CT model as
 an opaque composite actor inside another model, use
 CTMixedSignalDirector (if the outer model is a discrete-event
 model) or CTEmbeddedDirector (if the outer model is a CT model or a Modal
 model with a HSFSMDirector.)
 <P>
 This director recognizes actors that implement the CTStepSizeControlActor
 interface and adjusts the step size by polling such actors. If all actors
 are content with the current step size, then it attempts to raise the
 step size. If any actor is not satisfied with the current step size, then
 this director reduces the step size. A special case is that if there are
 no CT step size control actors, then this director uses 5 times of the
 current step size or the maximum step size, whichever is smaller.
 <P>
 This director has two more parameters than the CTDirector base class.<BR>
 <UL>
 <LI><I>ODESolver</I>: The name of the ODE solver that is used
 to integrate ODEs over a time interval.
 <LI><I>breakpointODESolver</I>: The name of the ODE solver used
 at breakpoints. The breakpoint ODE solvers do not need history information
 (this property is called self-start). Currently, there is only one such
 solver available,
 {@link ptolemy.domains.ct.kernel.solver.DerivativeResolver}.

     *  process includes a discrete phase of execution and a continuous phase
     *  of execution.
     *  <P>
     *  To resolve the final states at the time point t_0, a discrete
     *  phase of execution is performed. A discrete phase of execution
     *  at a time point is a fixed-point iteration, where the fixed
     *  point is reached when no more events exist and there will be
     *  no more events to be generated at that time point. To be
     *  concrete, at a discrete phase execution, event generators,
     *  purely discrete actors, waveform generators, and continuous
     *  actors are repeatedly iterated. The discrete phase of execution
     *  stops only when no event generators generate any more events. At the
     *  ending of the execution, the system states are resolved,
     *  which are called the final states at t_0. These states are marked as
     *  known good states for roll back purpose. The solver for the discrete
     *  phase of execution is a breakpoint ODE solver.
     *  <P>
     *  The way we find the fixed point is based on the synchronous reactive
     *  semantics. To be specific, the directors resolve the value of each
     *  signal from <i>unknown</i> to be either <i>absent</i> or
     *  <i>present</i>. This design is simple but firing all actors at each
     *  breakpoint causes overhead.
     *  <p>
     *  We could have used a smarter event queue like the one used by the DE
     *  director. Therefore only those actors with trigger events will be
     *  executed. However, this design will increase the complexity of this
     *  class. We assume that a CT model does not have many DE actors inside.
     *  If the discrete part of the model is complicated with a lot of DE
     *  actors, we would suggest using an opaque DE composite actor to
     *  encapsulate these DE actors and associate the composite actor with a
     *  DE director to take charge of the execution of those DE actors.
     *  <p>
     *  A continuous phase of execution immediately follows a discrete one,
     *  which solves the initial states at t_1. The initial states at t_1 are
     *  resolved by a normal ODE solver. This process is a normal integration
     *  over a time interval.
     *  <p>
     *  The ending time point t_1 of an iteration is determined by the step
     *  sizes suggested by the step size control actors and the earliest entry
     *  in the breakpoint table. A correct step size is no greater than the
     *  smallest suggested step size, and the current time plus the step size
     *  should not be later than the first entry in the breakpoint table.
     *  <p>
     *  Because of the existence of unpredictable events, a step size
     *  may need to be refined. Another reason to adjust step size is
     *  to achieve a reasonably accurate approximation of states. The
     *  mechanism to control step size is described below. After the
     *  states are resolved, step size control actors in the dynamic
     *  actor schedule and the state transition schedule are queried
     *  for the accuracy of the current step size. If any one of them
     *  is not satisfied with the current step size, then the states
     *  will be recalculated with a refined step size, which is the
     *  minimum of the refined step sizes from all step size control
     *  actors in the dynamic actor schedule and the state transition
     *  schedule. On the other hand, if all the above actors are
     *  satisfied with the current step, then the actors in the output
     *  path will be fired according to the output schedule. Then, the
     *  step size control actors in the output path will be checked
     *  for accuracy. If any actor is not satisfied with the current
     *  step size, the current step size is refined. Note that states
     *  have to be resolved again with this new step size. States are
     *  completely resolved only when all actors agree that the step size
     *  is accurate.
