/**
 Interface for CT transparent directors. This director extends the
 CTGeneralDirector interface.
 <p>
 Transparent directors in the CT domain can transfer their internal step size
 control information to the executive director. This interface defines methods
 to support the step size control queries by the executive CTDirector,
 such that after the internal CT subsystem finishes one integration step,
 its step size control information will be accessible by the outside
 CT director.
 <P>
 Directors that implement this interface are typically contained by
 CTCompositeActors.
