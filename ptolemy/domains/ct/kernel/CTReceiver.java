/**
 The receiver for the continuous-time and mixed-signal domain. The receiver
 can be of one of the two types: CONTINUOUS and DISCRETE. Conceptually,
 a CONTINUOUS CTReceiver contains a sample of a continuous signal at a
 particular time (defined by the CTDirector). Thus, there is one and
 only one token at all time in a CONTINUOUS CTReceiver. A DISCRETE
 CTReceiver contains a discrete event. Thus a DISCRETE CTReceiver may
 be empty if an event is not present.
 <P>
 The receiver is implemented as a Mailbox of capacity one. Any token put
 in the receiver overwrites any token previously present in the receiver.
 As a consequence, hasRoom() method always returns true.
 <P>
 The behavior of the get() method depends on the type of the receiver.
 If it is CONTINUOUS, then get() only reads the value. Consecutive calls on
 the get method will return the same token if the put method has not been
 called. For a CONTINUOUS CTReceiver, hasToken() will always return true
 after the first put() has been called. For a DISCRETE
 CTReceiver, get() will return and destroy the token, thus the token
 can only be retrieved once. Therefore after the consumption, the hasToken()
 method will return false, until a token is put into this receiver.
