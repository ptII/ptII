/**
 This solver finds the derivatives of the state variables of an ODE
 with respect to the current time.
 For example, if the ODE is
 <pre>
 x' = f(x, u, t),
 </pre>
 the current time is t0, and
 <pre>
 x(t0) = x0,
 </pre>
 then this method calculates
 <pre>
 x'(t0) = f(x(t0), u(t0), t0).
 </pre>

 <P>
 The derivative is obtained by firing the system for one iteration.
 This is used for preparing the history for other methods.
 Note that time does not progress under this solver.
 So, this class implements BreakpointODESolver and can only be
 used as a breakpoint solver.
