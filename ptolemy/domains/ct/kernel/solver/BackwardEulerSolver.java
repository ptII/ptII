/**
 The Backward Euler ODE solver. For an ODE
 <pre>
 x' = f(x, u, t), x(0) = x0
 </pre>
 This solver uses the following formula to solve it:
 <pre>
 x(t+h) = x(t) + h*x'(t+h)
 </pre>
 where x(t) is the current state, x(t+h) is the next
 state, h is the step size, and x'(t+h) is the derivative of x at t+h.
 The formula above is an algebraic equation, and this solver uses fixed
 point iteration to solve it.
 <P>
 This solver does not perform step size control even when the states do not
 converge after the maximum number of iterations is reached. However, CT
 directors may try to reduce step size. This solver does not give suggestions
 on choosing step size.
