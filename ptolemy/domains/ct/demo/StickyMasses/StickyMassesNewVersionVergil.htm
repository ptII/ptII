<h1>StickyMassesNewVersion</h1>
This page contains an applet that should appear as a separate window.
<p>This model is a modified version of the Sticky Masses model made by Jie Liu.

<p>One key feature of this model is that each state refinement can only have 
the same set of port names and these names are the same as the names of the 
modal model ports.</p>

<p>Another feature is that the state transitions has a "triggering" semantics.
Once the transition is enabled, it must be taken immediately. This process 
takes zero time. With this triggering semantics, piecewise continuous-time 
signals are generated as shown in the plots of velocities and accelerations.</p>

<p>The third feature is that an event detection mechanism is associated with the
process of checking enabled guard expressions. For example, given
a guard expression, x &gt;= 0.0, the event detection mechanism will ensure that
the transition will only be taken at a time point where the x resides in the 
range [0.0, error tolerance). This feature makes it easier for model designers 
to develop modal models.</p>
