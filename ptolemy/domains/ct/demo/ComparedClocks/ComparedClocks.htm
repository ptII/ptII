This demo shows that different clocks have 
different behaviors in CT domain.

The clocks have the same period as 0.5. 
The above two clocks have offsets as {0.0, 0.2},
while the bottom one has offsets as {0.1, 0.2}.

<p>The two continuous clocks generate discontinuities
at their offsets and the discontinuities are shown
on the simulations results explicitly. While the
discrete clock doesn't show that.

<p>The <a href="ComparedClocksVergil.htm">block diagram</a>
for the model was constructed using the Ptolemy II schematic editor
called Vergil.
