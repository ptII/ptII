<H1>2D-Helicopter Control System: A hierarchical hybrid control system</H1>


<P>
 <!-- All of the controls of the applet should be visible when the
applet is displayed on a XGA screen-->
<!-- PT DEPLOYJAVA CONVERTER -->
<p>
Helicopter is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "Helicopter.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="HelicopterVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

This applet models a high-attitude take off motion of a helicopter with a modal controller. Only the motion along longitudinal and vertical axes is considered (so we call it a 2-D helicopter).
<P>
The x, z-axes of the spatial frame are pointing north and down. The body x-axis is defined from the center of gravity to the nose of the helicopter, and body z-axis is pointing down from the center of gravity (CG). The motion of the helicopter is controlled by the main rotor thrust, and the longitudinal tilt path angle.
<P>
Flight modes represent different modes of operation of the helicopter and they correspond to controlling different variables in the dynamic. We define the following flight modes: Hover, Cruise, Acc/ALH, Dec/ALH, Climb, and Descend, where ALH stands for "ALtitude Hold."
<P>
The control uses approximate feedback linearization and pole placement.
The top level system looks like.
<P>
The climb action consists of a sequence of flight modes. Inside the controller
block is the FSM domain, where each FSM state represents a flight mode. Each
flight mode is further refined into a continuous time controller. The model
inside the controller is shown below.
<p>
This applet is implemented in MoML, as shown in a
