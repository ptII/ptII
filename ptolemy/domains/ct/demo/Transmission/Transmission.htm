Transmission is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "Transmission.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="TransmissionVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

<p>This model shows a model of a car with a transmission.  A transmission is generally used when an engine has a relatively narrow band over which the maximum power of the engine is available.  In order to obtain high torque over a wider range of speeds, the engine is connected to a set of gears with different size ratios (the transmission).  The efficiency function used for this model can be seen <a href="EfficiencyCurve.htm">in this model</a>.</p>

<p>A car with a transmission is a classic example of a hybrid system, since the continuous dynamics of the car depend on the current discrete state of the transmission.  An automatic transmission can be viewed as a feedback control system which takes the current continuous and discrete states of the system, in addition to the throttle input from a driver, and generates a signal which is the current gear selection.  Designing a "good" transmission that balances driver comfort (minimum jerkiness) with performance (maximum applied torque) over all parameters (engine speed, vehicle speed, and throttle) while incorporating practical details (implementation limitations, material wear) is a challenging problem.</p>
