This model shows a following car tracking a leading car in an unreliable 
communication environment.

CarTracking is available in two formats:
<ul>
  <li> As a Web Start Application: 
<!-- See http://blogs.sun.com/thejavatutorials/entry/deployment_toolkit_101 -->
<script src="../../../../../doc/deployJava.js"></script>
<script >
    var dir = location.href.substring(0,location.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1);
    var url = dir + "CarTracking.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url);
</script>
 <li> As an <a href="CarTrackingVergil.htm">applet</a>.
</ul>  
The Java Web Start version is preferred, though browsers with versions of Java
earlier than Java 1.6.0_13 may only work with the applet version.
See <a href="../../../../../doc/webStartHelp.htm">Web Start Help</a> for details.

This model shows a following car tracking a leading car in an unreliable 
communication environment. In normal operation, the leading car informs
the following car about its position, speed, acceleration, and a time 
stamp for this information. The following car does a sanity check to make
sure that the data are coherent. If so, the following car will apply the
same acceleration, and thus (in this simple model) tracks the leading 
car perfectly. 
<br>A user can determine when the communication channel fault
will occur and when it well end by setting the faultStartTime and 
faultStopTime parameters. 
<br>If the following car receives incorrect information, it abandons the 
received acceleration, and relies on distance measurements for tracking. 
In this mode, the following car will apply zero acceleration, if it is too
close to the leading car, and maximum acceleration if it is too far from 
the leading car. This (simple-minded) control law results in a rather
jerky ride.

<p>The <a href="CarTrackingVergil.htm">block diagram</a>
for the model was constructed using the Ptolemy II schematic editor
called Vergil.
<p> An alternate version of this model is called the
<a href="../V2V/V2V.htm">V2V (Vehicle 2 Vehicle) model</a>
