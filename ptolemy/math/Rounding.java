//// Rounding

/**
 The Rounding class provides a type safe enumeration of strategies for
 handling loss of numeric resolution when rounding. Rounding is typically
 resolved when quantization constraints are applied to a computed result
 in order to satisfy the requirements of the type to which the result is to be
 assigned.
 <p>
 Rounding is an abstract class for all rounding strategies.
 The primary method of this class is {@link #round(BigDecimal) round}. This
 method will round a BigDecimal value to the appropriate integer
 and return a BigInteger object.
 <p>
 {@link BigDecimal} objects are rounded by calling the
 {@link BigDecimal#setScale(int)} method with the appropriate
 rounding mode. Several static methods are provided in this class
 to support this functionality for each of the supported rounding
 modes. In addition, several static singleton rounding strategies
 are provided by this class to implement one of the supported
 routing modes.  Each of these rounding strategies are modeled
 after the rounding strategies provided by {@link BigDecimal}
 and include:

 <ul>

 <li> <i><b>up</b></i> <br>
 Rounding mode to round away from zero.
 Always increments the digit prior to a non-zero discarded fraction.
 Note that this rounding mode never decreases the magnitude of
 the calculated value.
 This rounding mode is supported by the static
 {@link #roundUp(BigDecimal) roundUp} method and the Rounding
 singletons {@link #GENERAL}, {@link #UNKNOWN} and {@link #UP}.

 <li> <i><b>down</b></i> <br>
 Rounding mode to round towards zero.
 Never increments the digit prior to a discarded fraction
 (i.e., truncates). Note that this rounding mode never increases
 the magnitude of the calculated value.
 This rounding mode is supported by the static
 {@link #roundDown(BigDecimal) roundDown} method and the Rounding
 singleton {@link #DOWN}.

 <li> <i><b>floor</b></i> <br>
 Rounding mode to round towards negative infinity.
 If decimal is positive, behave as <b>round down</b>;
 if decimal is negative, behave as <b>round up</b>.
 This rounding mode is supported by the static
 {@link #roundFloor(BigDecimal) roundFloor} method and the Rounding
 singleton {@link #FLOOR}.

 <li> <i><b>ceiling</b></i> <br>
 Rounding mode to round towards positive infinity.
 If decimal is positive, behave as <b>round up</b>;
 if decimal is negative, behave as <b>round down</b>.
 This rounding mode is supported by the static
 {@link #roundCeiling(BigDecimal) roundCeiling} method and the Rounding
 singleton {@link #CEILING}.

 <li> <i><b>half up</b></i> <br>
 Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor" unless
 both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round up.
 Behaves as for <b>round up</b> if the discarded fraction is >= .5;
 otherwise, behaves as for <b>round down</b>. Note that this is the
 rounding mode that most of us were taught in grade school.
 Rounding mode to round towards zero.
 This rounding mode is supported by the static
 {@link #roundHalfUp(BigDecimal) roundHalfUp} method and the Rounding
 singleton {@link #HALF_UP}.

 <li> <i><b>half down</b></i> <br>
 Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor" unless
 both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round down.
 Behaves as for <b>round up</b> if the discarded fraction is > .5;
 otherwise, behaves as for <b>ROUND_DOWN</b>.
 This rounding mode is supported by the static
 {@link #roundHalfDown(BigDecimal) roundHalfDown} method and the Rounding
 singleton {@link #HALF_DOWN}.

 <li> <i><b>half even</b></i> <br>
 Rounding mode to round towards the "nearest neighbor" unless
 both neighbors are equidistant, in which case, round towards
 the even neighbor. Behaves as for <b>round half up</b>
 if the digit to the left of the discarded fraction is odd;
 behaves as for <b>round half down</b> if it's even.
 Note that this is the rounding
 mode that minimizes cumulative error when applied repeatedly
 over a sequence of calculations.
 This rounding mode is supported by the static
 {@link #roundHalfEven(BigDecimal) roundHalfEven} method and the Rounding
 singletons {@link #HALF_EVEN} and {@link #CONVERGENT}.

 <li> <i><b>half floor</b></i> <br>
 Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor" unless
 both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round
 "ceiling". Behaves as <b>round half down</b>
 if the decimal is positive and as <b>round half up</b>
 if the decimal is negative. Note that there is no half floor rounding
 mode supported for BigDecimal values.
 This rounding mode is supported by the static
 {@link #roundHalfFloor(BigDecimal) roundHalfFloor} method and
 the Rounding singleton {@link #HALF_FLOOR}.

 <li> <i><b>half ceiling</b></i> <br>
 Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor" unless
 both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round
 "ceiling". Behaves as <b>round half up</b> if the decimal
 is positive and as <b>round half down</b>
 if the decimal is negative.
 Note that there is no half ceiling rounding mode
 supported for BigDecimal values.
 This rounding mode is supported by the static
 {@link #roundHalfFloor(BigDecimal) roundHalfCeiling} method and
 the Rounding singleton {@link #HALF_CEILING}.

 </ul>


 A specific strategy may be chosen dynamically by invoking forName() or
 getName() with one of the above strategy names. Alternatively a strategy
 may be selected by using one of the static singletons.
 <p>
 The <i>truncate</i> and <i>nearest</i> strategies should be
 preferred since they
 correspond to capabilities available on many processors. Other
 rounding strategies may require costly code on practical hardware.
 <p>
 The active class functionality is provided by the quantize method which is
 normally invoked from Quantization.quantize.
