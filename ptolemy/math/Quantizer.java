/**
 This class provides a set of static methods for creating instances of
 the FixPoint class from doubles, integers, or fixed point numbers.
 The various round() methods return a fixed point value that is nearest
 to the specified number, but has the specified precision.  The various
 roundToZero() and truncate() methods return a fixed point value that
 is nearest to the specified number, but no greater in magnitude.  The
 various roundDown() methods return a the nearest fixed point less than
 the argument. The intention is to fill out this class with roundUp(),
 and roundNearestEven().  All of these methods may introduce
 quantization errors and/or overflow.

 This class has been reimplemented to perform all rounding by first
 constructing a FixPointQuantization and then using either the quantizing
 constructor of FixPoint or FixPoint.quantize. Users may find that their
 code simplifies if they do likewise.
