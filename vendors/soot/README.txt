Soot is a compiler optimization framework for Java.  It reads in bytecode
and produces bytecode as output.  It can be downloaded from 
http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/software.  Only the jar files of the classes
should be checked in here, because the full package is quite large.

Soot is Library GPL'd so we can't distribute it without source.

The soot libraries are now in $PTII/lib
